Abstract = {Visual data storytelling is gaining importance as a means of presenting
   data-driven information or analysis results, especially to the general
   public. This has resulted in design principles being proposed for
   data-driven storytelling, and new authoring tools being created to aid
   such storytelling. However, data analysts typically lack sufficient
   background in design and storytelling to make effective use of these
   principles and authoring tools. To assist this process, we present
   ChartStory for crafting data stories from a collection of user-created
   charts, using a style akin to comic panels to imply the underlying
   sequence and logic of data-driven narratives. Our approach is to
   operationalize established design principles into an advanced pipeline
   that characterizes charts by their properties and similarities to each
   other, and recommends ways to partition, layout, and caption story
   pieces to serve a narrative. ChartStory also augments this pipeline with
   intuitive user interactions for visual refinement of generated data
   comics. We extensively and holistically evaluate ChartStory via a trio
   of studies. We first assess how the tool supports data comic creation in
   comparison to a manual baseline tool. Data comics from this study are
   subsequently compared and evaluated to ChartStory's automated
   recommendations by a team of narrative visualization practitioners. This
   is followed by a pair of interview studies with data scientists using
   their own datasets and charts who provide an additional assessment of
   the system. We find that ChartStory provides cogent recommendations for
   narrative generation, resulting in data comics that compare favorably to
   manually-created ones.},

Abstract = {Data-driven storytelling has gained prominence in journalism and other
   data reporting fields. However, the process of creating these stories
   remains challenging, often requiring the integration of effective
   visualizations with compelling narratives to form a cohesive,
   interactive presentation. To help streamline this process, we present an
   integrated authoring framework and system, DataWeaver, that supports
   both visualization-to-text and text-to-visualization composition.
   DataWeaver enables users to create data narratives anchored to data
   facts derived from ``call-out{''} interactions, i.e., user-initiated
   highlights of visualization elements that prompt relevant narrative
   content. In addition to this ``vis-to-text{''} composition, DataWeaver
   also supports a ``text-initiated{''} approach, generating relevant
   interactive visualizations from existing narratives. Key findings from
   an evaluation with 13 participants highlighted the utility and usability
   of DataWeaver and the effectiveness of its integrated authoring
   framework. The evaluation also revealed opportunities to enhance the
   framework by refining filtering mechanisms and visualization
   recommendations and better support authoring creativity by introducing
   advanced customization options.},

Abstract = {Data visualization and journalism are deeply connected. From early
   infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has
   become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a
   communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism,
   harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge
   between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization
   research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand
   and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent
   metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and
   opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present
   this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and
   thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution
   to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts,
   emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism. We then
   summarize six roles of computing in journalism and their implications.
   Based on these implications, we provide propositions for visualization
   research concerning each role. Ultimately, by mapping the roles and
   propositions onto a proposed ecological model and contextualizing
   existing visualization research, we surface seven general topics and a
   series of research agendas that can guide future visualization research
   at this intersection.},

Abstract = {We present Roslingifier, a data-driven storytelling method for animated
   scatterplots. Like its namesake, Hans Rosling (1948-2017), a professor
   of public health and a spellbinding public speaker, Roslingifier turns a
   sequence of entities changing over time-such as countries and continents
   with their demographic data-into an engaging narrative elling the story
   of the data. This data-driven storytelling method with an in-person
   presenter is a new genre of storytelling technique and has never been
   studied before. In this article, we aim to define a design space for
   this new genre-data presentation-and provide a semi-automated authoring
   tool for helping presenters create quality presentations. From an
   in-depth analysis of video clips of presentations using interactive
   visualizations, we derive three specific techniques to achieve this:
   natural language narratives, visual effects that highlight events, and
   temporal branching that changes playback time of the animation. Our
   implementation of the Roslingifier method is capable of identifying and
   clustering significant movements, automatically generating visual
   highlighting and a narrative for playback, and enabling the user to
   customize. From two user studies, we show that Roslingifier allows users
   to effectively create engaging data stories and the system features help
   both presenters and viewers find diverse insights.},

Abstract = {In recent years, data-driven stories have found a firm footing in
   journalism, business, and education. They leverage visualization and
   storytelling to convey information to broader audiences. Likewise,
   immersive technologies, like augmented and virtual reality devices,
   provide excellent potential for exploring and explaining data, thus
   inviting research on how data-driven storytelling transfers to immersive
   environments. To gain a better understanding of this exciting novel
   research area, we conducted a scoping review on the emerging notion of
   immersive data-driven storytelling, extended by surveying immersive data
   journalism and by analyzing immersive games, selected based on community
   reviews and tags. We present our methodology for the survey and discuss
   prominent themes that coalesce the knowledge we extracted from the
   literature, journalism, and games. These themes include, among others,
   the spatial embodiment of narration, the incorporation of the users and
   their context into narratives, and the balance between guiding the user
   versus promoting serendipity. Our discussion of these themes reveals
   research opportunities and challenges that will inform the design of
   immersive data-driven stories in the future.},

Abstract = {Comics are an effective method for sequential data-driven storytelling,
   especially for dynamic graphs-graphs whose vertices and edges change
   over time. However, manually creating such comics is currently
   time-consuming, complex, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose DG
   COMICS, a novel comic authoring tool for dynamic graphs that allows
   users to semi-automatically build and annotate comics. The tool uses a
   newly developed hierarchical clustering algorithm to segment consecutive
   snapshots of dynamic graphs while preserving their chronological order.
   It also presents rich information on both individuals and communities
   extracted from dynamic graphs in multiple views, where users can explore
   dynamic graphs and choose what to tell in comics. For evaluation, we
   provide an example and report the results of a user study and an expert
   review.},

   compelling manner. The compelling aspect of effective narrative
   visualization consequentially results in the potential to shift the
   attitude of an audience. However, there is much to understand about how
   narrative visualization can best be designed to influence target
   audiences. This paper focuses on an empirical experiment where we
   examined the effects of two communication strategies-anthropomorphism
   and personal identification-on a young adult audience. In particular, we
   wanted to understand which strategy, when integrated into narrative
   visualization, can nudge a specific audience's attitude towards greater
   consideration in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results
   indicated that the personal identification communication strategy was
   the most successful in nudging participants. This study contributes a
   better grasp of how technologies such as narrative visualization, using
   different communication strategies, can deliver more targeted messaging.},

Journal = {INFORMATION VISUALIZATION},
Year = {2025},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Narrative visualization is a method for conveying data or information in
   an engaging storytelling form using interactive visualizations. This
   method integrates storytelling and visualization techniques to represent
   information through organized narratives for effective communication.
   Narrative visualization has gained increasing interest in many
   data-driven domains like business, healthcare, governance, and
   education. However, the literature indicates limited insights and
   organization regarding advances in narrative visualization, particularly
   in its design elements and methodologies. This survey paper aims to
   present a comprehensive overview of the taxonomy, methodologies,
   challenges, and emerging opportunities in recent narrative visualization
   research. The paper firstly introduces the fundamental concepts of
   narrative visualization and its application trends across domains.
   Emerging trends and taxonomy were derived from the survey to provide an
   overview of advances in narrative visualization. The derived taxonomy
   classifies narrative visualization works with regards to the types of
   design, genre, narrative, and enabler technologies. Next, summarizations
   of common methodologies adopted by recent works particularly on design
   requirement identification and design evaluation are presented.
   Subsequently, major challenges addressed by recent works are classified
   based on three aspects: application, performance, and technical. Lastly,
   this survey highlights the emerging opportunities in narrative
   visualizations for future undertaking or exploration by the
   visualization community. The findings presented in this paper can offer
   significant advantages for both visualization practitioners and
   researchers in generating effective narrative visualization solutions.},

Abstract = {We are experiencing a health literacy crisis worldwide, which has
   alarming effects on individuals' medical outcomes. This poses the
   challenge of communicating key information about health conditions and
   their management in away that is easily understood by a general
   audience. In this paper, we propose the use of data-driven storytelling
   to address this challenge, in particular through interactive data
   comics. We developed an interactive data comic that communicates cancer
   data. A between-group study with 98 participants was carried out to
   evaluate the data comic's ease of understanding and engagement, compared
   to a text medium that captures the same information. The study reveals
   that the data comic is perceived to be more engaging, and participants
   have greater recall and understanding of the data within the story,
   compared with the text medium.},

   limited. In this article, we present a case study that explores the
   benefits of including data visualization best practices in the
   development of a software system for the current health crisis. We
   performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of sixteen graphs
   required by the system to monitor patients' isolation and circulation
   permits in quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed
   that the use of storytelling techniques in data visualization
   contributed to an improved decision-making process in terms of
   increasing information comprehension and memorability by the system

Abstract = {When telling a data story, an author has an intention they seek to
   convey to an audience. This intention can be of many forms such as to
   persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to
   expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable
   and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories,
   numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a
   plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create
   the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life
   by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable,
   memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the
   analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and
   identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we
   illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of
   ``character-oriented design{''}. We identify the roles and visual
   representations data characters assume as well as the types of
   relationships these roles have with one another. We identify
   characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data
   stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the
   audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify
   their visual representations. We then illustrate ``character-oriented
   design{''} by showing how to develop data characters with common data
   story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters
   derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data
   storytelling process using character-oriented design. To access our

   the results of an empirical study conducted to compare the performance
   of various narrative communication techniques including frame based
   narrative visualization, documentary narrative visualization, computer
   generated text narratives and human generated text narratives. We assess
   the knowledge transfer performance for each of these data driven
   narrative structures. Across all conditions, an identical set of
   knowledge retention questions assessed participants' recall of details
   from their assigned narrative communication. Statistical analysis on
   group performance answering the knowledge retention questions revealed
   that some narrative communication techniques perform better with general

Abstract = {Visualization is a powerful technique for analysis and communication of
   complex, multidimensional, and time-varying data. However, it can be
   difficult to manually synthesize a coherent narrative in a chart or
   graph due to the quantity of visualized attributes, a variety of salient
   features, and the awareness required to interpret points of interest
   (POs). We present Temporal Summary Images (TSIs) as an approach for both
   exploring this data and creating stories from it. As a visualization, a
   TSI is composed of three common components: (1) a temporal layout, (2)
   comic strip-style data snapshots, and (3) textual annotations. To
   augment user analysis and exploration, we have developed a number of
   interactive techniques that recommend relevant data features and design
   choices, including an automatic annotations workflow. As the analysis
   and visual design processes converge, the resultant image becomes
   appropriate for data storytelling. For validation, we use a prototype
   implementation for TSIs to conduct two case studies with large-scale,
   scientific simulation datasets.},

Abstract = {Knowledge communication in cultural heritage and digital humanities
   currently faces two challenges, which this paper addresses: On the one
   hand, data-driven storytelling in these fields has mainly focused on
   human protagonists, while other essential entities (such as artworks and
   artifacts, institutions, or places) have been neglected. On the other
   hand, storytelling tools rarely support the larger chains of data
   practices, which are required to generate and shape the data and
   visualizations needed for such stories. This paper introduces the
   InTaVia platform, which has been developed to bridge these gaps. It
   supports the practices of data retrieval, creation, curation, analysis,
   and communication with coherent visualization support for multiple types
   of entities. We illustrate the added value of this open platform for
   storytelling with four case studies, focusing on (a) the life of
   Albrecht D \& uuml;rer (person biography), (b) the Saliera salt cellar
   by Benvenuto Cellini (object biography), (c) the artist community of
   Lake Tuusula (group biography), and (d) the history of the Hofburg
   building complex in Vienna (place biography). Numerous suggestions for
   future research arise from this undertaking.},

Abstract = {Narrative visualization is characterized by the integration of data
   visualization and storytelling techniques. These characteristics provide
   challenges in its evaluation. Little is known about how these evaluation
   challenges are addressed by narrative visualization practitioners. We
   surveyed experienced narrative visualization practitioners to
   investigate their methods of evaluation. To gain deeper insight we
   conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with practitioners. We
   found that there is usually an informal approach to narrative
   visualization evaluation, where practitioners rely on prior experience
   and their peers for evaluation. Our study also revealed novel approaches
   to evaluation. We introduce a practice-led heuristic framework to aid
   practitioners to evaluate narrative visualization systematically. Our
   practice-led heuristic framework couples first-hand practitioner
   experience with recent research literature. This work sheds light on how
   to address narrative visualization evaluation to better inform both
   academic research and practice.},

Abstract = {Conveying a narrative with visualizations often requires choosing an
   order in which to present visualizations. While evidence exists that
   narrative sequencing in traditional stories can affect comprehension and
   memory, little is known about how sequencing choices affect narrative
   visualization. We consider the forms and reactions to sequencing in
   narrative visualization presentations to provide a deeper understanding
   with a focus on linear, ``slideshow-style{''} presentations. We conduct
   a qualitative analysis of 42 professional narrative visualizations to
   gain empirical knowledge on the forms that structure and sequence take.
   Based on the results of this study we propose a graph-driven approach
   for automatically identifying effective sequences in a set of
   visualizations to be presented linearly. Our approach identifies
   possible transitions in a visualization set and prioritizes local
   (visualization-to-visualization) transitions based on an objective
   function that minimizes the cost of transitions from the audience
   perspective. We conduct two studies to validate this function. We also
   expand the approach with additional knowledge of user preferences for
   different types of local transitions and the effects of global
   sequencing strategies on memory, preference, and comprehension. Our
   results include a relative ranking of types of visualization transitions
   by the audience perspective and support for memory and subjective rating
   benefits of visualization sequences that use parallelism as a structural
   device. We discuss how these insights can guide the design of narrative
   visualization and systems that support optimization of visualization
   sequence.},

   tools into the hands of designers. The classification shows that current
   data-driven storytelling practice does not yet leverage the full
   repertoire of media that can be used for storytelling, such as the
   spoken word, e-learning, and video games. Using our taxonomy as a
   generative tool, we also explore three novel storytelling mechanisms,

Abstract = {Storytelling teaches. All good storytelling is good teaching.
   Storytelling is a form of teaching and learning because it asks the
   readers or listeners to replace well-established explanations that are
   considered facts with new, unexpected ones. We always learn new things
   when listening to good stories. Good stories do so by violating
   expectations and surprising the listener or the reader. Surprise breeds
   suspense, which generates engagement, which is a catalyst for learning -
   even truer for scientific and data-driven stories. In this paper we show
   how understanding the nature of good stories by focusing on the novelty
   they introduce and assumption they violate helps us to do effective
   scientific work and tell excellent data-based stories. We start by
   providing definitions of ``story,{''} ``storytelling,{''} and ``good
   stories.{''} We then outline a methodology for building stories and
   provide an illustrative example of an effective data-based story from
   the history of medicine.},

   Data-Driven Storytelling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The current paper focuses on the development of an enhanced Mobile
   Journalism (MoJo) model for soundscape heritage crowdsourcing,
   data-driven storytelling, and management in the era of big data and the
   semantic web. Soundscapes and environmental sound semantics have a great
   impact on cultural heritage, also affecting the quality of human life,
   from multiple perspectives. In this view, context- and location-aware
   mobile services can be combined with state-of-the-art machine and deep
   learning approaches to offer multilevel semantic analysis monitoring of
   sound-related heritage. The targeted utilities can offer new insights
   toward sustainable growth of both urban and rural areas. Much emphasis
   is also put on the multimodal preservation and auralization of special
   soundscape areas and open ancient theaters with remarkable acoustic
   behavior, representing important cultural artifacts. For this purpose, a
   pervasive computing architecture is deployed and investigated, utilizing
   both client- and cloud-wise semantic analysis services, to implement and
   evaluate the envisioned MoJo methodology. Elaborating on
   previous/baseline MoJo tools, research hypotheses and questions are
   stated and put to test as part of the human-centered application design
   and development process. In this setting, primary algorithmic backend
   services on sound semantics are implemented and thoroughly validated,
   providing a convincing proof of concept of the proposed model.},

Abstract = {As data journalism continues to rise, narrative visualization has
   emerged as an essential method for conveying information. To improve the
   user experience of narrative visualization projects for data journalism,
   this study introduces an innovative approach for narrative visualization
   design centered on user experience. Firstly, through an in-depth
   analysis of existing research, we constructed a comprehensive
   user-experience-based narrative visualization model, considering the
   designers' design process and the multiple levels of the user experience
   process. Then, through case analysis and user interviews, we identified
   the key elements that influence the user experience. Through the
   analysis of multiple cases, this study presents a practical narrative
   visualization design methodology comprising eight dimensions, aimed at
   enhancing user experience. The primary contribution of this research
   lies in the proposal of a practical narrative visualization model and
   the clear definition of key design elements, providing a comprehensive
   reference framework for designers and researchers to effectively
   optimize the user experience of narrative visualization. Moreover, our
   research findings unveil the inherent correlation between user
   experience and design elements, offering valuable insights for future
   research and practical applications.},

Abstract = {In recent years, narrative visualization has gained much attention.
   Researchers have proposed different design spaces for various narrative
   visualization genres and scenarios to facilitate the creation process.
   As users' needs grow and automation technologies advance, increasingly
   more tools have been designed and developed. In this study, we
   summarized six genres of narrative visualization (annotated charts,
   infographics, timelines \& storylines, data comics, scrollytelling \&
   slideshow, and data videos) based on previous research and four types of
   tools (design spaces, authoring tools, ML/AI-supported tools and
   ML/AI-generator tools) based on the intelligence and automation level of
   the tools. We surveyed 105 papers and tools to study how automation can
   progressively engage in visualization design and narrative processes to
   help users easily create narrative visualizations. This research aims to
   provide an overview of current research and development in the
   automation involvement of narrative visualization tools. We discuss key
   research problems in each category and suggest new opportunities to
   encourage further research in the related domain.},

Abstract = {Documentary narrative visualization is a data visualization approach
   using the features of documentary film. Researchers in the field of
   visualization are searching for better methods of constructing
   narratives from data sets. In this article, we explore the structure and
   techniques of documentary film and how they apply to the practice of
   constructing narrative visualization with video. We review the
   structural aspects of documentary film with examples relevant for
   narrative visualization. Using six of the highest quality video-based
   narrative visualizations, we conducted a study of user preferences for
   three pairs of videos. The video pairs were specifically matched to
   highlight unique features available in documentary film. Using the
   preferences expressed by our participants, we performed an empirical
   study to examine the documentary features most valued by our
   participants. Our results provide implications about the style and
   features of documentary film that are most useful in the construction of
   narrative visualization. Overall, this work provides a clear starting
   point for the construction of documentary narrative visualization
   providing content creators with specific techniques that will improve
   engagement of their content.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the
   context of data storytelling for data workers. Data storytelling
   communicates insights and knowledge from data analysis. It plays a vital
   role in data workers' daily jobs since it boosts team collaboration and
   public communication. However, to make an appealing data story, data
   workers need to spend tremendous effort on various tasks, including
   outlining and styling the story. Recently, a growing research trend has
   been exploring how to assist data storytelling with advanced artificial
   intelligence (AI). However, existing studies focus more on individual
   tasks in the workflow of data storytelling and do not reveal a complete
   picture of humans' preference for collaborating with AI. To address this
   gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 data workers to explore
   their preferences for AI collaboration in the planning, implementation,

Abstract = {Narrative visualization transforms data into engaging stories, making
   complex information accessible to a broad audience. Foundation models,
   with their advanced capabilities such as natural language processing,
   content generation, and multimodal integration, hold substantial
   potential for enriching narrative visualization. Recently, a collection
   of techniques have been introduced for crafting narrative visualizations
   based on foundation models from different aspects. We build our survey
   upon 66 articles to study how foundation models can progressively engage
   in this process and then propose a reference model categorizing the
   reviewed literature into four essential phases: Analysis, Narration,
   Visualization, and Interaction. Furthermore, we identify eight specific
   tasks (e.g., Insight Extraction and Authoring) where foundation models
   are applied across these stages to facilitate the creation of visual
   narratives. Detailed descriptions, related literature, and reflections
   are presented for each task. To make it a more impactful and informative
   experience for diverse readers, we discuss key research problems and
   provide the strengths and weaknesses in each task to guide people in
   identifying and seizing opportunities while navigating challenges in
   this field.},

Abstract = {While the consumption of visual information becomes a daily commodity
   integrated into our lives, data visualisation is dominated by dashboards
   and charts. The main contribution of this article is an advanced way to
   visualise data as a data story. We converged paradigms from digital
   storytelling, serious games, and data visualisation to turn data into
   useful insights. The creation, management, and analysis of data have
   been increasingly given more attention in industry and professional
   practices. However, the potential of packaging data and analytic results
   into easily digestible and visually explorable content intended for
   non-professional audiences has not yet been investigated to its full
   extent. We contributed towards overcoming the gap between data analytics
   and data presentation. By integrating a story-like environment and
   entertainment into data visualisation, we explore the possibilities of
   efficiently communicating data and insights to general audiences in a
   casual context. We present this modular approach to customising messages
   for visual data storytelling from an information and communication
   perspective, including a test prototype developed to illustrate our data
   storytelling framework.},

Abstract = {Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal
   stories within data, yet these ``data stories{''} differ in important
   ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially
   online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations
   into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to
   function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically
   review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations:
   Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we
   identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize
   these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in
   terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author
   (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on
   the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our
   framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization,
   including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic
   storytelling and educational media.},

Abstract = {Data videos increasingly becoming a popular data storytelling form
   represented by visual and audio integration. In recent years, more and
   more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective
   and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides
   a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been
   adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about
   applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little
   systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a
   specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to
   manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this
   gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey
   as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we
   examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data
   videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages,
   sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey
   structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide
   practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for
   different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure,
   Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our
   proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants
   were invited to design data videos with and without our design space
   guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our
   design space provides useful and practical guidance for data
   storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey.},

Abstract = {Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data
   insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data
   story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it
   can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's
   Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in
   film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and
   discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little
   systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's
   Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we
   examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing
   stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we
   proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual
   communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative
   intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques
   through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a
   workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space

Abstract = {Data-driven storytelling has grown significantly, becoming prevalent in
   various fields, including healthcare. In medical narratives, characters
   are crucial for engaging audiences, making complex medical information
   accessible, and potentially influencing positive behavioral and
   lifestyle changes. However, designing characters that are both
   educational and relatable to effectively engage audiences is
   challenging. We propose a GenAI-assisted pipeline for character design
   in data-driven medical stories, utilizing Stable Diffusion, a deep
   learning text-to-image model, to transform data into visual character
   representations. This approach reduces the time and artistic skills
   required to create characters that reflect the underlying data. As a
   proof-of-concept, we generated and evaluated two characters in a
   crowd-sourced case study, assessing their authenticity to the underlying
   data and consistency over time. In a qualitative evaluation with four
   experts with knowledge in design and health communication, the
   characters were discussed regarding their quality and refinement
   opportunities. The characters effectively conveyed various aspects of
   the data, such as emotions, age, and body weight. However, generating
   multiple consistent images of the same character proved to be a
   significant challenge. This underscores a key issue in using generative
   AI for character creation: the limited control designers have over the
   output.},

Abstract = {Interactive visualizations play a key part in the exploration and

   describes a new graph-based framework for developing interactive
   visualizations for creating coherent visual data stories. We have
   realized our framework in a prototype tool named Gravity++. Gravity++
   uses a novel graph architecture for modeling interaction, data
   navigation, and changes in visual representation to better communicate
   findings to an audience. The combination of these graph models provides
   better support and flexibility for designing interactive visualizations,
   data navigation, and visual data stories. We demonstrate the
   applicability of this framework by two example usage scenarios. We also
   report on an evaluation study conducted with representative
   participants. All participants successfully created meaningful visual
   data stories with a high level of complexity. Our results also show that
   Gravity++ is easy to use and supports the understanding and sense-making
   of the visual data story creation process.},

Abstract = {As part of the project Forest Carbon Futures, I present reflections from
   a communitybased initiative to co-design public resources for data
   understanding, engagement, and advocacy at the intersection of forest
   and climate research and policy. This work leverages critical, creative
   approaches, strategies and insights from visual communication design,
   narrative visualisation, and related practices to express complex forest
   carbon data in ways that preserve ecological specificity while
   supporting meaningful connections between diverse publics, data
   representations, more-than-human communities, and real-world
   implications and possibilities. Through a lens of storytelling and
   ecological situatedness, we seek to re-frame extractive narratives that
   homogenise and decontextualise the forest, and foster visual
   sense-making practices that convey a visceral sense of place alongside
   the complex, mycelial role of forest carbon in our lives. Here I discuss
   initial insights from our co-design process in order to inform future
   work surrounding ecological and climate data literacies, focusing
   particularly on avenues for invoking ecological place and narrative in
   fostering community-organising, policy-making, and advocacy.},

Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Storytelling is recognized as a valid and important method of
   communicating information and knowledge gleaned from volumes of
   ever-accumulating data. Practices of data-driven storytelling in
   journalism and geovisual analytics have contributed to the development
   of geovisual stories; also called story maps. The benefits of
   student-focused multi-thematic atlases and digital storytelling methods
   in education can also be realized in story maps. An online, interactive
   version of the original paper version of the Wyoming Student Atlas was
   developed using story mapping technology. Studies on best practices for
   data-driven storytelling and web map interaction were used to inform the
   transition of the atlas from a traditional paper format to a collection
   of story maps. Evaluation of the atlas story maps for educational
   purposes was conducted by observing students from multiple classrooms as
   they used the story maps in a lesson. The students and educators
   responded to a survey after using the story maps. Results of the survey
   show positive responses to the atlas story maps, including ease of use
   and preference over a traditional paper atlas. However, certain types of
   interaction with the map resulted in increased negative or uncertain
   responses from students concerning their perception of the atlas story
   maps.},

   Spatio-Temporal Context},
Journal = {COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {42},
Number = {6},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Large-scale issues with a spatial and temporal context such as the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the war against Ukraine, and climate change have
   given visual storytelling with data a lot of attention in online
   journalism, confirming its high effectiveness and relevance for
   conveying stories. Thus, new ways have emerged that expand the space of
   visual storytelling techniques. However, interactive visual data stories
   with a spatio-temporal context have not been extensively studied yet.
   Particularly quantitative information about the used layout and media,
   the visual storytelling techniques, and the visual encoding of
   space-time is relevant to get a deeper understanding of how such stories
   are commonly built to convey complex information in a comprehensible
   way. Covering these three aspects, we propose a design space derived by
   merging and adjusting existing approaches, which we used to categorize
   130 collected web-based visual data stories with a spatio-temporal
   context from between 2018 and 2022. An analyzis of the collected data
   reveals the power of large-scale issues to shape the landscape of
   storytelling techniques and a trend towards a simplified consumability
   of stories. Taken together, our findings can serve story authors as
   inspiration regarding which storytelling techniques to include in their
   own spatio-temporal data stories.},

   techniques to convey a compelling story. Narrative visualization is
   notoriously difficult to evaluate. One solution is heuristic evaluation,
   using a domain-specific set of heuristics. This paper validates a set of
   heuristics proposed specifically for evaluating narrative visualization.
   We conducted studies with experienced narrative visualization
   practitioners in both summative and formative settings. We found that
   the set of heuristics showed promise in a summative setting, where
   similar responses evidenced that the set of heuristics could provide
   reliable evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in a formative setting,
   implementing the set of heuristics was reported to be useful in the
   design process; however, due to their limited focus, we recommend that
   it be implemented in conjunction with other evaluation guidelines.},

Title = {Integrating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility into a Data
   Storytelling Model for Health Informatics Education},
Journal = {APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {05},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background Health informatics education is pivotal in integrating
   diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) principles into
   curricula and leveraging data with equity considerations. Integrating
   clinically driven data with other datasets is crucial to comprehensive
   understanding of patient care demographics, experiences, and outcomes to
   create equity-minded data storytelling. Publicly available Healthy
   People 2030 (HP2030) resources complement academic electronic health
   records, supporting tailored learning activities in informatics
   education to enhance educational utility through a DEIA lens. Objectives
   This case report describes the expansion of an existing diversity,
   equity, and inclusion (DEI) checklist to an updated DEIA checklist for
   preparing future informaticians to collect and critically evaluate DEIA
   features using this checklist in creating equity-minded data
   storytelling. Methods The DEI-Oriented Data Storytelling Model and the
   HP2030 framework were utilized to develop the DEIA checklist. We
   employed an informal cognitive walkthrough to expand the DEIA checklist
   and evaluate the DEIA measures or characteristics within datasets from
   the HP2030 social determinants of health (SDOH) five topics using this
   checklist. Results We reviewed 76 available SDOH-related datasets and
   added six measures to ``demographics{''} and seven to ``skills,
   abilities, and accessibility{''} of the DEIA checklist. Our evaluation
   of the DEIA checklist verified HP2030's inclusion of all measures,
   except ``religions/beliefs.{''} All DEIA measures were linked to equity
   and accessibility, one in inclusion, and the inclusion of three
   characteristics comprising the category ``language{''} and six
   characteristics comprising the category ``images.{''} Conclusion Results
   highlighted the accessibility and comprehensiveness of HP2030
   demographic data resources, considering SDOH factors and promoting
   inclusive data representation to address health disparities. The DEIA
   checklist provides a structured tool in facilitating unbiased data
   collection and visualization of SDOH-related data through an
   equity-informed lens. Integrating an equity-minded data storytelling
   with frameworks like HP2030 enriches health informatics education,
   broadens students' understanding of health disparities, and supports
   evidence-based interventions for improved health outcomes.},

Abstract = {Narrative visualizations combine conventions of communicative and
   exploratory information visualization to convey an intended story. We
   demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for
   understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular
   interpretations in visualizations that ``tell a story{''} can
   significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between
   narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies
   in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices
   for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information
   visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of
   concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political
   theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or
   omissions of information at various levels-the data, visual
   representation, textual annotations, and interactivity-and how
   visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated
   viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques
   identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations
   are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical
   contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and
   researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of
   visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative
   visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a
   visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify
   areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve
   understanding of visualization interpretation.},

Abstract = {Data visualizations have been increasingly used in oral presentations to

   introductions of visualizations to explain how to interpret the visually
   encoded information are essential to convey the takeaways and avoid
   misunderstandings. We contribute a series of studies to investigate how
   to effectively introduce visualizations to the audience with varying
   degrees of visualization literacy. We begin with understanding how
   people are introducing visualizations. We crowdsource 110 introductions
   of visualizations and categorize them based on their content and
   structures. From these crowdsourced introductions, we identify different
   introduction strategies and generate a set of introductions for
   evaluation. We conduct experiments to systematically compare the
   effectiveness of different introduction strategies across four
   visualizations with 1,080 participants. We find that introductions
   explaining visual encodings with concrete examples are the most
   effective. Our study provides both qualitative and quantitative insights
   into how to construct effective verbal introductions of visualizations

   financial factors within institutional constraints. Gaining a better
   understanding of how these transitions occur is crucial for continuing
   to improve water management. This paper presents a replicable
   methodology for analyzing how urban water utilities transition toward
   sustainability. The method combines standardized quantitative measures
   of variables that influence transitions with contextual qualitative
   information about a utility's unique decision making context to produce
   structured, data-driven narratives. Data-narratives document the broader
   context, the utility's pretransition history, key events during an
   accelerated period of change, and the consequences of transition.
   Eventually, these narratives should be compared across cases to develop
   empirically-testable hypotheses about the drivers of and barriers to
   utility-level urban water management transition. The methodology is
   illustrated through the case of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer
   Department (WASD) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its transition
   toward more sustainable water management in the 2000s, during which per
   capita water use declined, conservation measures were enacted, water
   rates increased, and climate adaptive planning became the new norm.},

Abstract = {Data storytelling holds much potential to positively impact public
   perceptions of libraries. However, realizing the potential of library
   data storytelling will require understanding practical and cultural
   obstacles within public and other library contexts that range from
   prioritizing data collection over communication to fearing regulatory
   and assessment uses of data. Based on mixed qualitative methods (34
   interviews, a questionnaire, a ranking exercise, post-workshop
   discussions) and six years of iteratively developed data storytelling
   workshops, this article explores common obstacles - emotions and
   attitudes; time, tools, and training - to library data storytelling and
   proposes ways to overcome them.},

Abstract = {Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their
   creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight
   discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the
   communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data
   storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of
   user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the
   system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's
   intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that
   leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to
   customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for
   existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback
   through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and
   dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the
   user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals.
   We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the
   implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a
   quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to
   a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that
   Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of
   insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the
   usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and
   highlight areas of future work.},

Abstract = {GIFs are enjoying increasing popularity on social media as a format for
   data-driven storytelling with visualization; simple visual messages are
   embedded in short animations that usually last less than 15 seconds and
   are played in automatic repetition. In this paper, we ask the question,
   ``What makes a data-GIF understandable?{''} While other storytelling
   formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively
   well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and
   principles for ``data-GIFs{''}. To close this gap, we provide results
   from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118
   participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the
   understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis
   are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108
   data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design
   dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context
   preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core
   message. The paper concludes with a list of suggestions for creating
   more effective Data-GIFs.},

Abstract = {Data videos, or short data-driven motion graphics, are an increasingly
   popular medium for storytelling. However, creating data videos is
   difficult as it involves pulling together a unique combination of
   skills. We introduce DataClips, an authoring tool aimed at lowering the
   barriers to crafting data videos. DataClips allows non-experts to
   assemble data-driven ``clips{''} together to form longer sequences. We
   constructed the library of data clips by analyzing the composition of
   over 70 data videos produced by reputable sources such as The New York
   Times and The Guardian. We demonstrate that DataClips can reproduce over
   90\% of our data videos corpus. We also report on a qualitative study
   comparing the authoring process and outcome achieved by (1) non-experts
   using DataClips, and (2) experts using Adobe Illustrator and After
   Effects to create data-driven clips. Results indicated that non-experts
   are able to learn and use DataClips with a short training period. In the
   span of one hour, they were able to produce more videos than experts
   using a professional editing tool, and their clips were rated similarly
   by an independent audience.},

Abstract = {We present V-Mail, a framework of cross-platform applications,
   interactive techniques, and communication protocols for improved
   multi-person correspondence about spatial 3D datasets. Inspired by the
   daily use of e-mail, V-Mail seeks to enable a similar style of rapid,
   multi-person communication accessible on any device; however, it aims to
   do this in the new context of spatial 3D communication, where limited
   access to 3D graphics hardware typically prevents such communication.
   The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration,
   spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail ``data stories{''}
   are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common
   baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework
   also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins
   that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data
   exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various
   devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to
   annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations
   are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D
   graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client,
   implemented as a plugin. Results and evaluation from applying V-Mail to
   assist communication within an interdisciplinary science team studying
   Antarctic ice sheets confirm the utility of the asynchronous,
   cross-platform collaborative framework while also highlighting some
   current limitations and opportunities for future work.},

Abstract = {Motivation: Narrative visualization for scientific data explorations can
   help users better understands the domain knowledge, because narrative
   visualizations often present a sequence of facts and observations linked
   together by a unifying theme or argument. Narrative visualization in
   immersive environments can provide users with an intuitive experience to
   interactively explore the scientific data, because immersive
   environments provide a brand new strategy for interactive scientific
   data visualization and exploration. However, it is challenging to
   develop narrative scientific visualization in immersive environments. In
   this article, we propose an immersive narrative visualization tool to
   create and customize scientific data explorations for ordinary users
   with little knowledge about programming on scientific visualization.
   They are allowed to define point of interests (POIs) conveniently by the
   handler of an immersive device.
   Results: Automatic exploration animations with narrative annotations can
   be generated by the gradual transitions between consecutive POI pairs.
   Besides, interactive slicing can be also controlled by device handler.
   Evaluations including user study and case study are designed and
   conducted to show the usability and effectiveness of the proposed tool.},

Abstract = {Collocated teamwork remains a pervasive practice across all professional
   sectors. Even though live observations and video analysis have been
   utilized for understanding embodied interaction of team members, these
   approaches are impractical for scaling up the provision of feedback that
   can promote developing high-performance teamwork skills. Enriching
   spaces with sensors capable of automatically capturing team activity
   data can improve learning and reflection. Yet, connecting the enormous
   amounts of data such sensors can generate with constructs related to
   teamwork remains challenging. This article presents a framework to
   support the development of human-centered embodied teamwork analytics by
   1) enabling hybrid human-machine multimodal sensing; 2) embedding
   educators' and experts' knowledge into computational team models; and 3)
   generating human-driven data storytelling interfaces for reflection and
   decision making. This is illustrated through an in-the-wild study in the
   context of healthcare simulation, where predictive modeling, epistemic
   network analysis, and data storytelling are used to support educators
   and nursing teams.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest in presenting data clearly to users. One of
   the ways to increase engagement and understanding of this data is
   through narrative visualizations, as they utilize elements that can
   enhance understanding of the presented data in different ways. In this
   context, after a literature review on elements of narrative data
   visualizations, we identified a gap in detailed descriptions of
   narrative genres. Considering this, we conducted a focus group with
   professionals in the field, which resulted in the concept called ``Navis
   Structure.{''} It organizes narrative genres into components for design
   assistance. In this case, the genres can be single-component or
   multi-component. Additionally, these genres were classified, considering
   not only this structure but also visual representation, interaction
   techniques, freedom of exploration, and narrative approach. Finally, we
   conducted a workshop with professionals experienced in data
   visualization to analyze and validate the proposed concept, believing
   that the findings contribute to advancing the understanding of narrative
   genres and guide future research in narrative data visualizations.},

Abstract = {Causality visualization can help people understand temporal chains of
   events, such as messages sent in a distributed system, cause and effect
   in a historical conflict, or the interplay between political actors over
   time. However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences
   grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this
   paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven
   storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose
   a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal
   data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where
   participants were asked to recover causality information from two
   causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and
   without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe
   CAUSEWORKS, a causality visualization system for understanding how
   specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates
   an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We
   validate CAUSEWORKS through interviews with experts who used the system
   for understanding complex events.},

Abstract = {With the proliferation of big data and business analytics practices,
   data storytelling has gained increasing importance as an effective means
   for communicating analytical insights to the target audience to support
   decision-making and improve business performance. However, there is a
   limited empirical understanding of the relationship between data
   storytelling competency, decision-making quality, and business
   performance. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), this study
   develops and validates the concept of data storytelling competency as a
   multidimensional construct consisting of data quality, story quality,
   storytelling tool quality, storyteller skills, and storyteller domain
   knowledge. It also develops a mediation model to examine the
   relationship between data storytelling competency and business
   performance, and whether this relationship is mediated by
   decision-making quality. Based on an empirical analysis of data
   collected from business analytics practitioners, the results of this
   study reveal that the data storytelling competency is positively linked
   to business performance, which is partially mediated by decision-making
   quality. These results provide a theoretical basis for further
   investigation of possible antecedents and consequences of data
   storytelling competency. They also offer guidance for practitioners on
   how to leverage data storytelling capabilities in business analytics
   practices to improve decision-making and business performance.},

Abstract = {The following study addresses, from a design perspective, narrative
   visualization using augmented reality (AR) in real physical spaces, and
   specifically in spaces with no semantic relation with the represented
   data. We intend to identify the aspects augmented reality adds, as
   narrative possibilities, to data visualization. Particularly, we seek to
   identify the aspects augmented reality introduces regarding the three
   dimensions of narrative visualization-view, focus and sequence. For this
   purpose, we adopted a comparative analysis of a set of fifty case
   studies, specifically, narrative visualizations using augmented reality
   from a journalistic scope, where narrative is a key feature. Despite the
   strong explanatory character that characterizes the set of analyzed
   cases, which sometimes limits the user's agency, there is a strong
   interactive factor. It was found that augmented reality can expand the
   narrative possibilities in the three dimensions mentioned-view, focus
   and sequence-but especially regarding visual strategies where simulation
   plays an essential role. As a visual strategy, simulation can provide
   the context for communication or be the object of communication itself,
   as a replica.},

Abstract = {This paper explores narrative techniques combined with medical
   visualizations to tell data-driven stories about diseases for a general
   audience. The field of medical illustration uses narrative visualization
   through hand-crafted techniques to promote health literacy. However,
   data-driven narrative visualization has rarely been applied to medical
   data. We derived a template for creating stories about diseases and
   applied it to three selected diseases to demonstrate how narrative
   techniques could support visual communication and facilitate
   understanding of medical data. One of our main considerations is how
   interactive 3D anatomical models can be integrated into the story and
   whether this leads to compelling stories in which the users feel
   involved. A between-subject study with 90 participants suggests that the
   combination of a carefully designed narrative structure, the constant
   involvement of a specific patient, high-qualitative visualizations
   combined with easy-to-use interactions, are critical for an
   understandable story about diseases that would be remembered by
   participants. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper defines, analyzes, and discusses the emerging genre of
   visualization atlases. We currently witness an increase in web-based,
   data-driven initiatives that call themselves ``atlases{''} while
   explaining complex, contemporary issues through data and visualizations:
   climate change, sustainability, AI, or cultural discoveries. To
   understand this emerging genre and inform their design, study, and
   authoring support, we conducted a systematic analysis of 33
   visualization atlases and semi-structured interviews with eight
   visualization atlas creators. Based on our results, we contribute (1) a
   definition of a visualization atlas as a compendium of (web) pages aimed
   at explaining and supporting exploration of data about a dedicated topic
   through data, visualizations and narration. (2) a set of design patterns
   of 8 design dimensions, (3) insights into the atlas creation from
   interviews and (4) the definition of 5 visualization atlas genres. We
   found that visualization atlases are unique in the way they combine i)
   exploratory visualization, ii) narrative elements from data-driven
   storytelling and iii) structured navigation mechanisms. They target a
   wide range of audiences with different levels of domain knowledge,
   acting as tools for study, communication, and discovery. We conclude
   with a discussion of current design practices and emerging questions
   around the ethics and potential real-world impact of visualization

Abstract = {Data storytelling is rapidly gaining prominence as a characteristic
   activity of digital journalism with significant adoption by small and
   large media houses. While a handful of previous studies have examined
   what characterises aspects of data storytelling like narratives and
   visualisation or analysis based on single cases, we are yet to see a
   systematic effort to harness these available resources to gain better
   insight into what characterises good data stories and how these are
   created. This study analysed 44 cases of outstanding data storytelling
   practices comprising winning entries of the Global Editors Network's
   Data Journalism Award from 2013 to 2016 to bridge this knowledge gap.
   Based on a conceptual model we developed, we uniformly characterised
   each of the 44 cases and then proceeded to determine types of these
   stories and the nature of technologies employed in creating them. Our
   findings refine the traditional typology of data stories from the
   journalistic perspective and also identify core technologies and tools
   that appear central to good data journalism practice. We also discuss
   our findings in relations to the recently published 2017 winning
   entries. Our results have significant implications for the required
   competencies for data journalists in contemporary and future newsrooms.},

   Constructing Data-Driven Policy Narratives},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of data-driven narratives to examine how
   the use of information, communications, and media technologies (ICMTs)
   impacts the sustainable growth of economies. While ICMTs have regularly
   been advocated as a policy tool for growth and development, there is a
   research gap in empirical studies validating how such policies may be
   effective. This analysis is based on historical panel data from 39
   economies across the developed North (19) and developing South (20). The
   industry-standard Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
   (CRISP-DM) methodology was applied to construct narratives that weave
   extant theories with empirical data. The art of developing data-driven
   narratives is rarely addressed in previous research articles. In the
   narrative approach, prior research on how ICMTs and sustainable growth
   are quantitatively scored and measured is reviewed. Panel data from
   authoritative sources such as the United Nations, World Economic Forum,
   and Sustainable Society Index were collected, cleansed, and
   conglomerated for data analytics. This was followed by evidence-based
   reasoning to examine any possible relationships between ICMT development
   and the sustainable growth of economies across the ``North{''} and
   ``South{''}. The findings reveal that there are differentiated outcomes
   in sustainable growth in high- and low-income economies. This poses
   legitimate questions as to whether low-income economies will be able to
   meet the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 through the
   intermediation of ICMTs. It is the intended contribution of this paper
   to exemplify how data-driven narratives using CRISP may construct rich
   stories about ICMT for sustainability for the purposes of sharing good
   practice as well as lessons learned.},

Title = {Using the S-DIKW framework to transform data visualization into data

Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {76},

Pages = {803-818},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Communicating insights from data effectively requires design skills,
   technical knowledge, and experience. Data must be accurately represented
   with aesthetically pleasing visuals and engaging text to effectively
   communicate to the intended audience. Data storytelling has received
   much attention lately, but as of yet, it does not have a theoretical and
   practical foundation in information science. A data story adds context,
   narrative, and structure to the visual representation of data, providing
   audiences with character, plot, and a holistic experience of narrative.
   This paper proposes a methodological approach to transform a data
   visualization into a data story based on the
   Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the S-DIKW
   Framework. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid, the proposed
   approach defines a strategy to represent insights extracted from data.
   Data is then turned into information by identifying character(s) facing
   a problem, adding textual and graphic content; information is turned
   into knowledge by organizing what happens as a plot. Finally, a call to
   wise action-always informed by cultural and community values-completes
   the storytelling transformation to create a data story. This article
   contributes to the theoretical understanding of data stories as emerging
   information forms, supporting richer understandings of a story as
   information in the information sciences.},

Journal = {COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},
Number = {3},
Pages = {277-289},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the visualization community, it is often assumed that visual data
   storytelling increases memorability and engagement, making it more
   effective at communicating information. However, many assumptions about
   the efficacy of storytelling in visualization lack empirical evaluation.
   Contributing to an emerging body of work, we study whether selected
   techniques commonly used in visual data storytelling influence people's
   attitudes towards immigration. We compare (a) personal visual narratives
   designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of
   aggregates of people; and (c) an exploratory visualization without
   narrative acting as a control condition. We conducted two crowdsourced
   between-subject studies comparing the three conditions, each with 300
   participants. To assess the differences in attitudes between conditions,
   we adopted established scales from the social sciences used in the
   European Social Survey (ESS). Although we found some differences between
   conditions, the effects on people's attitudes are smaller than we
   expected. Our findings suggest that we need to be more careful when it
   comes to our expectations about the effects visual data storytelling can
   have on attitudes. Additional material:

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},

Volume = {10},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the use of narrative visualizations as an effective
   way to improve communication, engagement, and knowledge transfer in
   research-practice partnerships (RPPs). I report on the experience of
   developing a narrative visualization reporting research findings to
   educators/school leaders in an RPP focused on providing more equitable
   access to high school mathematics courses for multilingual students
   {[}referred to as English learners (ELs) in the US]. The narrative
   visualization was intended to allow easy interpretation of information
   on: (i) student rates of completion of courses that are critical to
   becoming eligible for college admission; (ii) student mathematics course
   trajectories; and (iii) mathematics course placement decisions. Using
   the notion of graphical excellence, I identify specific visualization
   strategies and features that improve the quality of the narrative
   visualization and support practitioners use of them. Drawing on
   liberatory design thinking, I discuss how this form of reporting
   findings builds trust and facilitates engagement between partners,
   increases practitioners' agency, and thus creates more equitable power
   dynamics in RPPs and for the multilingual students at the core of the
   one discussed here.},

Abstract = {Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly popular for organizing and
   managing knowledge across various industries and academic fields.
   Knowledge graphs assist users to better understand domain knowledge by
   reorganizing and aggregating information. In the application scenario,
   recent research has mainly focused on constructing knowledge graphs to
   create narrative visualizations from the perspective of humanities
   expert, but the mapping relationship between knowledge graphs and
   narrative scripts which visualization designers specialize in remains
   largely unexplored. This paper aims to explore the use of cultural
   heritage knowledge graphs for producing narrative scripts that
   creatively preserve and communicate cultural heritage. To achieve this,
   the researchers constructed an ethnic costumes knowledge graph based on
   data collected from the Chinese National Museums of Ethnology and a
   literature survey. We conducted an experiment to identify typical
   patterns in data exploration and narrative scripts that linked to the
   designers' authorial intent and process. Based on our analysis, we
   present design recommendations for narrative visualization with
   knowledge graphs that could provide practical guidance in designing
   cultural heritage information visualization.},

   combines otherwise incommensurable qualities into a coherent description

   results in reinforcing effects and an increase in stock market

Abstract = {We present a methodology for making sense of the communicative role of
   data visualizations in journalistic storytelling and share findings from
   surveying water-related data stories. Data stories are a genre of
   long-form journalism that integrate text, data visualization, and other
   visual expressions (e.g., photographs, illustrations, videos) for the
   purpose of data-driven storytelling. In the last decade, a considerable
   number of data stories about a wide range of topics have been published
   worldwide. Authors use a variety of techniques to make complex phenomena
   comprehensible and use visualizations as communicative devices that
   shape the understanding of a given topic. Despite the popularity of data
   stories, we, as scholars, still lack a methodological framework for
   assessing the communicative role of visualizations in data stories. To
   this extent, we draw from data journalism, visual culture, and
   multimodality studies to propose an interpretative framework in six
   stages. The process begins with the analysis of content blocks and
   framing elements and ends with the identification of dimensions,
   patterns, and relationships between textual and visual elements. The
   framework is put to the test by analyzing 17 data stories about
   water-related issues. Our observations from the survey illustrate how
   data visualizations can shape the framing of complex topics.},

Abstract = {Data journalism is increasingly vital in our data-driven society,
   requiring professionals to gather, analyze, and visualize data for
   public understanding. While scholars recognize its significance, the
   audience-centric aspects remain underexplored. This study focuses on
   Eco-Nai+, a digital geo-journalism platform aiming to be Nigeria's
   first. It provides interactive data access via web and mobile apps and
   tools for geospatial data handling. Employing a multi-method approach,
   including document analysis, interviews, and platform analysis, this
   study examines how geo-data enhances data-driven storytelling, fosters
   cooperation and co-creation in data collection, and creates a new income
   stream for news organizations. From a business standpoint, Eco-Nai +
   functions as a ``newstech{''} company, capitalizing on digital age
   challenges. It offers journalists a means to inform and engage the
   public and policymakers in vital environmental discussions, especially
   in environments with limited open data sources. Crowdsourcing data is
   critical in this context, where open data and freedom of information
   legislation are lacking. This research contributes to the data
   journalism discourse by exploring audience involvement in data-driven
   storytelling and advocating for public participation in data journalism
   projects to enhance reporting and understand data's societal role. It
   also underscores the value of geojournalism skills in delivering spatial
   products and thematic maps, adding context and insights beyond numerical
   data. Eco-Nai + exemplifies the potential for data journalism to bridge
   information gaps and drive meaningful conversations in an increasingly
   data-centric world.},

Title = {A data-driven narratives skeleton pattern recognition from accident
   reports dataset for human-and-organizational-factors analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accidents in the process industry involve several interacting factors,
   including human and organizational factors (HOFs). A long-standing
   obstacle to HOFs analysis is lack of data. Accident reports are an
   essential data source to learn from the past and contain HOFs-related
   data, but they are usually unstructured text in a not standardized
   format. Some studies have explored the extraction of information
   automatically from accident reports based on Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) techniques. However, they were not dedicated to HOFs. Risk
   communication is considered an essential pillar in safety and risk
   science. This research develops a HOFs-focused risk commu-nication
   framework based on the NLP techniques that can support risk assessment
   and mitigation. The proposed approach automatically extracts the target
   groups oriented ``Who, When, Where, Why{''} (4Ws) information from
   accident reports. This framework was applied to explore the eMARS
   database. The results show that the ``4Ws{''} skeleton of narratives has
   appreciated performance in pattern recognition and holistic information
   analysis. The graphical representation interfaces are designed to
   display the features of HOFs-related accidents, which can better be
   communicated to the sharp-end operators and decision-makers.},

Abstract = {PurposeData storytelling courses position students as agents in creating
   stories interpreted from data about a social problem or social justice
   issue. The purpose of this study is to explore two research questions:
   What themes characterized students' iterative development of data story
   topics? Looking back at six years of iterative feedback, what categories
   of data literacy pedagogy did instructors engage for these
   themes?.Design/methodology/approachThis project examines six years of
   data storytelling final projects using thematic analysis and three years
   of instructor feedback. Ten themes in final projects align with patterns
   in feedback. Reflections on pedagogical approaches to students' topic
   development suggest extending data literacy pedagogy categories -
   formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green,
   2020).FindingsData storytelling can develop students' abilities to move
   from being consumers to creators of data and interpretations. The
   specific topic of personal data exposure or risk has presented some
   challenges for data literacy instruction (Bowler et al., 2017). What
   ``personal{''} means in terms of data should be defined more broadly.
   Extending the data literacy pedagogy categories of formal, personal and
   folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020) could more effectively center
   social justice in data literacy instruction.Practical
   implicationsImplications for practice include positioning students as
   producers of data interpretation, such as role-playing data analysis or
   decision-making scenarios.Social implicationsData storytelling has the
   potential to address current challenges in data literacy pedagogy and in
   teaching critical data literacy.Originality/valueCourse descriptions
   provide a template for future data literacy pedagogy involving data
   storytelling, and findings suggest implications for expanding
   definitions and applications of personal and folk data literacies.},

Abstract = {This article presents a Statistical Process Control (SPC) framework
   considering the response process as a unit variable, which demands
   special treatment. This study designed a Shiny app related to data
   visualization and inferential estimation adopting SPC charts and Extreme
   Value Theory. We also proposed a new flexible unit probabilistic model
   (named FlexShape), which is simple yet overcomes skew information and
   bimodality in historical data, as part of the complex learning task.
   Results showed that the proposed framework enables it to handle unit
   data sets. As an example, we presented data storytelling from the water
   particle monitoring (relative humidity) from one Atacama Desert station,
   known to be one of the driest areas on Earth, across hidden patterns
   such as inundation and microweather. Finally, the developed framework
   makes possible any research on the univariate unit data decision-making,
   enabling the database import and adjusting some parametric models, and
   enabling the comparison of different units' distribution
   goodness-of-fit.},

Title = {Investigating the Effect of Visualization Literacy and Guidance on
   Teachers' Dashboard Interpretation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on
   designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization
   guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or
   narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or
   trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting
   visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students'
   learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers
   interpret students' data through these dashboards, many have overlooked
   the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly
   impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy
   (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret
   dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account
   exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual
   representations of students' data. In this paper, we address this gap by
   investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and
   without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We
   illustrate this by analyzing teachers' think-aloud sessions as they
   engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online
   learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs.
   Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in
   interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings
   revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard
   interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL
   with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also,
   visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their
   interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to
   complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be
   detrimental.},

Title = {GRETA analytics: Communicating the spatial dimension of energy

Journal = {SOFTWAREX},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research output from inter- and trans-disciplinary research projects is
   challenging to store, link, analyze, and communicate among stakeholders
   and researchers from other fields. Datasets, models, and methods are
   often non-interactive, hard to access and understand, and hidden in
   research articles with specific terminologies. Here, we present GRETA
   Analytics, an R Shiny application developed to communicate the output of
   the GRETA (GReen Energy Transition Actions) EU Horizon 2020 research
   project. The tool presents and visualizes data collected from
   qualitative case studies, an extensive multinational survey in 16 EU
   countries, their re-use in scenario predictions, and their framing for
   developing interactive transition pathways for individuals and
   communities. With a strong geospatial focus and a narrative design, the
   tool promotes collaborative sensemaking processes of the real world
   instead of plain visualization. This paper addresses the development
   process, design choices, data integration strategies, architecture
   details, and deployment methods of the tool. We demonstrate how using
   collaborative and interactive dashboards can enhance the communication
   of research projects and support a geographical understanding of energy
   citizenship and energy transition actions, which were the overall goals
   of the GRETA project.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a synthesised framework for the analysis of data
   visualisations in the news. Through a close examination of seminal
   content analyses, their methodologies and findings, this article
   proposes a framework that consolidates dimensional components of data
   visualisations previously scattered across this body of research. To
   transition from incidental and essentialist examinations of visual data
   artefacts towards a systematic and theory-informed exploration, we
   consider the diagrammatic dimensions of data visualisations. The offered
   synthesized framework can serve as a starting point for both
   theory-infused descriptive purposes as well as more theory-guided
   explorations. The framework is put to the test by analysing 185
   visualisations drawn from award-winning data stories. Findings generated
   through the application of the framework highlight the varied
   composition of components of data visualisations, though certain
   combinations of components are prevalent, leading to static categorical
   comparisons or interactive spatial localization. After all, data
   artefacts can be understood as problem-posing elements that are the
   outcome of diagrammatic thinking that journalists employ to communicate
   claims.},

Abstract = {Graph or network data are widely studied in both data mining and
   visualization communities to review the relationship among different
   entities and groups. The data facts derived from graph visual analysis
   are important to help understand the social structures of complex data,
   especially for data journalism. However, it is challenging for data
   journalists to discover graph data facts and manually organize
   correlated facts around a meaningful topic due to the complexity of
   graph data and the difficulty to interpret graph narratives. Therefore,
   we present an automatic graph facts generation system, Calliope-Net,
   which consists of a fact discovery module, a fact organization module,
   and a visualization module. It creates annotated node-link diagrams with
   facts automatically discovered and organized from network data. A novel
   layout algorithm is designed to present meaningful and visually
   appealing annotated graphs. We evaluate the proposed system with two
   case studies and an in-lab user study. The results show that
   Calliope-Net can benefit users in discovering and understanding graph
   data facts with visually pleasing annotated visualizations.},

Abstract = {We examine the process of designing an exhibit to communicate scientific
   findings from a complex dataset and unfamiliar domain to the public in a
   science museum. Our exhibit sought to communicate new lessons based on
   scientific findings from the domain of metagenomics. This multi-user
   exhibit had three goals: (1) to inform the public about microbial
   communities and their daily cycles; (2) to link microbes' activity to
   the concept of gene expression; (3) and to highlight scientists' use of
   gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. To address
   these three goals, we derived visualization designs with three
   corresponding stories, each corresponding to a goal. We present three
   successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to convey
   these goals. We could successfully present one story but had limited
   success with our second and third goals. This work presents a detailed
   account of an attempt to explain tightly coupled relationships through
   storytelling and animation in a multi-user, informal learning
   environment to a public with varying prior knowledge on the domain and
   identify lessons for future design.},

Abstract = {Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are
   widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They
   provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message
   and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is
   difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We
   investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in
   data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design
   space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific
   papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative
   interface enabling users to construct interactive references between
   text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to
   automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually
   construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with
   algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface
   provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.},

Abstract = {An impediment to effective Circular Economy (CE) implementation in
   residential buildings is the lack of standardized building data to
   represent a building's life cycle, from material sourcing to end-of-use

   for creating a circular web application named Data Homebase (DHB). DHB
   integrates housing data into Housing Passports (HPs), visualizing
   calculations of estimated energy use, carbon emissions, and
   affordability building indexes. Using data-driven narratives, DHB
   outlines a building's degree of circularity and potential for improved
   environmental outcomes via circular strategies. The passport system and
   data-based approach provide a once-missing portal entry for housing
   stakeholders seeking actionable circularity measurements. This research
   contributes to the long-term elucidation of key decision-making
   processes for homebuilding within a comprehensive tool to achieve a

   interrogate key tenets of Black Feminism and draw parallels between the
   famed entertainer and writers such as Nikki Giovanni, Margaret Walker,
   and Lucille Clifton. Students draw on quantitative and qualitative
   datasets to derive insight about Black literary art and compose
   interactive, visual narratives that reveal how Beyonce extends a long
   tradition of Black feminist themes. Overall, pop culture and online
   media becomes a means through which today's `digital native' student can

Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) dashboards are becoming increasingly available
   in various learning settings. However, teachers may face challenges in
   understanding and interpreting the data visualisations presented on
   those dashboards. In response to this, some LA researchers are
   incorporating visual cueing techniques, like data storytelling (DS),
   into LA dashboard design to reduce the data visualisation skills - often
   referred to as visualisation literacy (VL) - and cognitive effort
   required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. However, despite the
   potential of DS principles in simplifying data visualisations, there is
   limited evidence supporting their effectiveness in actually reducing
   teachers' cognitive load. The study presented in this paper addresses
   this gap by investigating the potential impact of LA dashboards, with
   and without DS elements, on teachers with varying VL levels. Through a
   quasi -experimental study involving 23 teachers, we analysed changes in
   pupil dilation - a proxy for cognitive load - as they examined LA
   dashboards featuring student data captured while participating in
   synchronous, online collaborative learning tasks. Our findings suggest
   DS can reduce cognitive load, particularly for teachers with lower VL.
   These results provide insight into the effects of DS and VL on teachers'
   cognitive load, thereby informing the design of LA dashboards.
   Implications for practice or policy: center dot Developers of LA
   dashboards need to pay more attention to incorporating visual and
   narrative elements that are easily comprehensible and target -oriented,
   based on users' visualisation literacy levels. center dot Educational
   providers and LA designers can recommend dashboards with DS elements to
   teachers with low VL to enhance their work efficiency.},

   to represent different scenarios in the construction of an aggregate
   measure prior to drawing recommendations for policy making. Finally, we
   try to establish a link between the analytic use of well-designed
   aggregate measures and the development of a robust culture of evaluation
   of policies based on evidence. An application of these concepts and
   tools to the Rule of Law index developed by the World Justice Project is
   given.},

Abstract = {Annotations play a vital role in highlighting critical aspects of
   visualizations, aiding in data externalization and exploration,
   collaborative sensemaking, and visual storytelling. However, despite
   their widespread use, we identified a lack of a design space for common
   practices for annotations. In this paper, we evaluated over 1,800 static
   annotated charts to understand how people annotate visualizations in
   practice. Through qualitative coding of these diverse real-world
   annotated charts, we explored three primary aspects of annotation usage
   patterns: analytic purposes for chart annotations (e.g., present,
   identify, summarize, or compare data features), mechanisms for chart
   annotations (e.g., types and combinations of annotations used, frequency
   of different annotation types across chart types, etc.), and the data
   source used to generate the annotations. We then synthesized our
   findings into a design space of annotations, highlighting key design
   choices for chart annotations. We presented three case studies
   illustrating our design space as a practical framework for chart
   annotations to enhance the communication of visualization insights. All

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {In a journalism and communication landscape where data plays an
   increasingly important role in crafting reliable and engaging stories,
   data storytelling has become an integral part of the industry.
   Traditionally, journalism has often followed a linear, author-driven,
   and explanatory approach to storytelling. However, the rise of data
   storytelling has prompted a significant shift towards more interactive
   and reader-driven stories, with a higher potential for exploration.
   While the literature in the field has studied aspects such as
   interactivity in data visualisations, linearity and storytelling
   structures, the discourse surrounding exploratory features of data
   stories is relatively recent and scarce, and it remains largely
   unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and studies the exploratory
   and explanatory characteristics of data stories, and their
   interdependencies. It further examines the relationships of these facets
   with other key attributes of data stories, specifically linearity,
   interactivity, and storytelling structures. This is done through
   analysing a broad selection of data stories (N = 118) sourced from a
   variety of news outlets. Results uncover the complementary roles
   exploratory and explanatory characteristics play in data stories, and
   reveal the nuances in relationships with the other three facets. The
   findings provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of data story
   design and practical insights for data journalists seeking to balance
   explanation and exploration in their narratives.},

Abstract = {In this article I problematize sequence as a necessary condition for

   but on what they do and how their meaning is ceaselessly deferred,
   breaching the narratological conventions of coherence and closure.
   Drawing on my work with Gwen John's letters, I trace three
   methodological movements in narrative analytics: a) creating an archive
   of stories as multiplicities of meanings, b) following the emergence of
   the narratable subject, and c) making narrative connections in the
   political project of re-imagining the subject of feminism.},

   leveraging advanced natural language processing technologies, numerous
   V-NLI systems have been developed in academic research and commercial
   software, especially in recent years. In this article, we conduct a
   comprehensive review of the existing V-NLIs. In order to classify each
   article, we develop categorical dimensions based on a classic
   information visualization pipeline with the extension of a V-NLI layer.
   The following seven stages are used: query interpretation, data
   transformation, visual mapping, view transformation, human interaction,
   dialogue management, and presentation. Finally, we also shed light on
   several promising directions for future work in the V-NLI community.},

Abstract = {This study employed qualitative content analysis to explore data-driven
   journalistic practices employed by mainstream and citizen journalists on
   X (formerly known as Twitter) and how these practices foster civic
   engagement among Ghanaian X users. The study was grounded in the
   materiality, performativity, and reflexivity framework of data
   journalism and the civic engagement model. The findings were that the
   main themes of data-driven narratives on X were politics, socioeconomic
   discourse, and particularly economic metrics. Materiality and
   performativity showed up in the human agency of journalists and in the
   skills and expertise of those who contextualise and interpret the data.
   Data journalists liaise with allied data production specialists to
   convert raw data into data artifacts to tell stories. Ghanaian X users
   actively used the offered data stories to participate in civic arguments
   and discussions on social media. They back data stories with personal
   anecdotes. Through the proactive deployment of surveys, the creation of
   X polls, and other cooperative efforts, the examined narratives
   illustrated the performativity of data journalism as a technique that
   subverts power structures. The study provides evidence for the important
   role of peripheral actors in data journalism and how their efforts drive
   civic discourse to potentially drive tangible societal transformations.},

Abstract = {Short-form videos are an increasingly prevalent medium for storytelling
   in journalism and marketing, of which information can be greatly

   design workshop with experienced video, animation designers and
   visualization experts to discuss principles and practices for augmenting
   short-form videos with data visualizations. After the workshop, we
   summarized the participants' design considerations and proposed 20
   design guidelines. We further collected design purposes of the
   participants and associated these purposes with the guidelines. Finally,
   we conducted a crowd-sourcing study and a task-based evaluation to
   validate the effectiveness and usability of the guidelines. Results
   indicate that our guidelines can significantly improve the videos
   accompanied with data visualizations and help novices easily obtain

Abstract = {This article explores the intersections between interactive documentary
   and digital rights, across notions of surveillance, privacy and data.
   The collection of personal and sensitive data online increases
   exponentially, and individuals become a series of data points, only of
   relevance insofar as we are part of a larger group marked by similar
   characteristics. Yet somewhat contradictorily, we are also scrutinized
   completely. How might creative media production bridge this gap -
   recognizing our individual complexity while respecting rights to
   privacy? Documentary media offers one response - individual stories and
   voices can serve to flesh out a complex story while retaining links to a
   broader narrative. Interactive documentary, furthermore, can offer a
   reflexive form of storytelling that uses the very forms of technology in
   question to highlight the potential problems. This article presents case
   studies of interactive documentaries, exploring how the strategies of
   reflexivity and responsiveness can engender an understanding of issues
   of digital rights.},

Title = {Sentiment and Emotion Network Analysis-SENA: An Analytic Framework and
   No-Code Software to Integrate Natural Language Processing, Linguistic
   Analysis, and Data Science with Qualitative and Mixed-Methods Research},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Sentiment and emotion analyses (SEA) provide us with the opportunity to
   gain objective and fast insights into the experiences of vast amounts of
   individuals. Despite SEA's efficiency, two main limitations associated
   with its use remain: outcome aggregation and narrow applicability.
   Outcome aggregation means that outputs do not consider participants'
   attributes nor allow for individual analyses of participants'
   experiences and/or the degree to which these experiences may express
   consistent or contradictory emotions (i.e., emotional entropy). Narrow
   applicability means that SEA has primarily been employed in market
   research to understand customers' satisfaction thus foregoing its
   applicability in qualitative and mixed methods academic research. With
   these opportunities and limitations in mind, our study was designed to
   offer an analytic framework that avoids outcome aggregation and expands
   the use of SEA beyond market research. As part of our study's
   contribution, we offer a free to use and free to distribute software
   tool that implements the totality of our proposed analytic framework.
   This software does not require any programming proficiency and executes
   all required back-end processes locally-thus avoiding the need to upload
   our data to any servers. In our proposed framework, outcome aggregation
   is avoided via network modeling that also enables testing for potential
   differences in emotions distributions across groups. Based on this
   integration, we refer to the resulting analytic framework and software
   as Sentiment and Emotion Network Analysis-SENA. As part of our
   methodological and research design discussion, we also illustrate how to
   integrate SENA with machine learning text classification of documents or
   open-ended responses. This integration serves to leverage the power of
   artificial intelligence in studies relying on SENA. The databases used
   to showcase this analytic framework are provided so that researchers may
   interact firsthand with the SENA framework and its externally
   peer-reviewed software (https://cutt.ly/BrhEnyfY) available in Mac
   (https://cutt.ly/QwhYruBr) and Windows (https://cutt.ly/YwhJJKvO)

Title = {StoryExplorer: A Visualization Framework for Storyline Generation
   of Textual Narratives},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 AUG 18},
Abstract = {In the context of the exponentially increasing volume of narrative texts
   such as novels and news, readers struggle to extract and consistently
   remember storylines from these intricate texts due to the constraints of
   human working memory and attention span. To tackle this issue, we
   propose a visualization approach StoryExplorer, which facilitates the
   process of knowledge externalization of narrative texts and further
   makes the form of mental models more coherent. Through the formative
   study and close collaboration with two domain experts, we identified key
   challenges for the extraction of the storyline. Guided by the distilled
   requirements, we then propose a set of workflow (i.e., insight
   finding-scripting-storytelling) to enable users to interactively
   generate fragments of narrative structures. We then propose a
   visualization system StoryExplorer that combines stroke annotation and
   GPT-based visual hints to quickly extract story fragments and
   interactively construct storylines. To evaluate the effectiveness and
   usefulness of StoryExplorer, we conducted two case studies and in-depth
   user interviews with 16 target users. The result shows that users can
   conveniently and effectively extract the storyline by using
   StoryExplorer along with the proposed workflow.},

Abstract = {The article documents connections and synergies between city museums'
   visions and programming as well as emerging smart city issues and
   dilemmas in a fast-paced urban environment marked with the processes of
   increasing digitalization and datafication. The research employs
   policy/document analysis and semi-structured interviews with smart city
   government representatives and museum professionals to investigating
   both smart city policy frameworks as well as city museum's data-driven
   installations and activities in New York, London and Singapore. A
   comparative program analysis of the Singapore City Gallery, Museum of
   the City of New York and Museum of London identifies such sites of data
   practices as Data storytelling, interpretation and eco-curation.
   Discussing these sites as dedicated spaces of smart citizen engagement,
   the article reveals that city museums can either empower their visitors
   to consider their roles as active city co-makers or see them as passive
   recipients of the smart city transformations.},

Abstract = {Authors use various media formats to convey disease information to a
   broad audience, from articles and videos to interviews or documentaries.
   These media often include human characters, such as patients or treating
   physicians, who are involved with the disease. While artistic media,
   such as hand-crafted illustrations and animations are used for health
   communication in many cases, our goal is to focus on data-driven
   visualizations. Over the last decade, narrative visualization has
   experienced increasing prominence, employing storytelling techniques to
   present data in an understandable way. Similar to classic storytelling
   formats, narrative medical visualizations may also take a human
   character-centered design approach. However, the impact of this form of
   data communication on the user is largely unexplored. This study
   investigates the protagonist's influence on user experience in terms of
   engagement, identification, self-referencing, emotional response,
   perceived credibility, and time spent in the story. Our experimental
   setup utilizes a character-driven story structure for disease stories
   derived from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Using this structure, we
   generated three conditions for a cerebral small vessel disease story
   that vary by their protagonist: (1) a patient, (2) a physician, and (3)
   a base condition with no human protagonist. These story variants formed
   the basis for our hypotheses on the effect of a human protagonist in
   disease stories, which we evaluated in an online study with 30
   participants. Our findings indicate that a human protagonist exerts
   various influences on the story perception and that these also vary
   depending on the type of protagonist.},

Journal = {INFORMATION POLITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The open government data (OGD) movement claims to contribute to
   transparency and increased citizen understanding of government action.
   However, the literature so far shows these goals are not being reached,
   as `common' (non-expert) citizens fail to access and understand OGD.
   This research makes an empirical contribution to this debate through a
   design experiment in the form of a field lab with a governmental agency,
   data visualization experts, and non-expert citizens in the Netherlands.
   In this field lab, the current practice of disseminating OGD by a
   regional water authority on the issue of drought was redesigned based on
   non-expert citizens' needs. Our findings show that non-expert citizens
   prefer data storytelling techniques over OGD portals or traditional OGD
   visualizations such as graphs or dashboards. This is informative for the
   current shift from OGD geared at expert users, to OGD geared at
   fostering effective transparency with non-expert users. We also build on
   existing research to develop new evaluation criteria for OGD
   visualizations, and find that completeness and usability seem more
   important than objectivity in disseminating OGD with non-expert citizens
   when communicating about complex policy problems.},

Abstract = {Learning in data-rich environments has been a focus of learning sciences
   research since the inception of the field, with increasing interest in
   the ways learners narrate data. This article examines the narration of
   data from the perspective of learning on the move, identifying
   mobilities of data, and of the narratives in which they are mobilized.
   Two case studies of data narration are presented: seventh graders in a
   social studies classroom, describing African-American migrations to and
   from a familiar neighborhood, using a census data visualization tool;
   and a presentation by the director of special education for a school
   district to the Board of Education, using data to describe trends in the
   district. Four modes of data narration are examined across cases: (1)
   telling a story about oneself working with data; (2) animating a data
   representation; (3) incorporating data into extant narratives; and (4)
   narrating oneself into a data-represented world. The analysis examines
   the ways data, narratives, and people are set in motion in each of these
   modes, and the ways the resulting mobilities mediate learning with data.},

Abstract = {Dashboards are used ubiquitously to gain and present insights into data
   by means of interactive visualizations. To bridge the gap between
   non-expert dashboard users and potentially complex datasets and/or
   visualizations, a variety of onboarding strategies are employed,
   including videos, narration, and interactive tutorials. We propose a
   process model for dashboard onboarding that formalizes and unifies such
   diverse onboarding strategies. Our model introduces the onboarding loop
   alongside the dashboard usage loop. Unpacking the onboarding loop
   reveals how each onboarding strategy combines selected building blocks
   of the dashboard with an onboarding narrative. Specific means are
   applied to this narration sequence for onboarding, which results in
   onboarding artifacts that are presented to the user via an interface. We
   concretize these concepts by showing how our process model can be used
   to describe a selection of real-world onboarding examples. Finally, we
   discuss how our model can serve as an actionable blueprint for
   developing new onboarding systems.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Public Administrations have made, in an exercise of
   transparency, an important effort to open their data with the aim that,
   through the reuse of this information, a real impact and value can be
   generated on the territory. However, on many occasions the complexity of
   the matter means that citizens are not able to perceive the benefits
   that can be derived from its use, and they distance themselves from the
   use of open data. In this same scenario, technological advances and a
   new culture of information consumption derived from the democratisation
   of its access have laid the foundations for the development of data
   journalism. Aragon Open Data, the Government of Aragon's commitment to
   open data, has developed a new service during 2020 that seeks to unite
   these two factors with the aim of encouraging the reuse of public sector
   data, educating about its possibilities and empowering the different
   user profiles in the use of public data. The result of the project,
   framed in its 2019-2022 strategy and co-financed by the European
   Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the European Union, is Aragon Open
   Data Focus, a free service that allows users of the portal to develop
   and share their own stories based on Aragon's open data.},

Abstract = {There is a large volume of spatiotemporally correlated multivariate data
   in multiple layers of the earth's environmental system. Compound events
   arise from the interaction of multiple variables. Current approaches
   employed by earth scientists lack the flexibility to identify the
   drivers and corresponding impacts of different events. In this paper, we
   present MVST-SciVis (MultiVariate SpatioTemporal Scientific data
   Visualization), a new visual analytics prototype to help scientists
   explore spatiotemporal correlations among multiple variables, and
   analyze the drivers and influences of different compound events.
   MVST-SciVis provides coordinated maps, scatterplots, line charts and bar
   charts to support a three-level multi-granularity complex visual
   analysis pipeline. MVST-SciVis also provides a storyline visualization
   tailored for scientific data that abstracts inter-entity relationships
   and the driving components information of compound events. Our case
   studies with the data from two ecosystem circles of climate and
   agriculture illustrate the usefulness and effectiveness of MVST-SciVis.},

   approaching and motivating Generation Z (Gen Z; born 1996-2012)
   donations. More specifically, the findings revealed that the
   participants (1) experienced pseudoinefficacy as they felt their small
   donations would not make a difference. In addition, they felt (2) a
   general lack of trust toward NPOs regarding financial stewardship.
   Finally, (3) they wanted organizations to develop data-driven narratives
   to share how funds were used to help the community. As such, the
   analysis and recommendations are rooted in Narrative Theory. Narrative
   strategies present a potential avenue for generating persuasion and
   fostering positive relationships between NPOs and emerging Gen Z donors.},

Abstract = {Datafication is reshaping feminism, as feminist pioneers, groups and
   communities increasingly engage with data practices for advocacy,
   activism and social change. This is a netnographic study exploring how
   feminist actors in China appropriate the emerging technology of
   datafication to develop grassroots narratives for pursuing gender
   justice, focussing on two pioneering feminist collectives as key
   studies. The study begins by reviewing the role of gender data in
   women's empowerment within China's socio-political context, followed by
   an outline of the feminist data narrative concepts that combine
   Couldry's theory of data as narrative with insights from data feminism.
   Using these two cases, it illustrates how and why these collectives
   engage in data feminism to foreground gender justice. These examples
   demonstrate the ways in which data narratives offer transformative and
   empowering potential, generating new epistemic imaginaries of feminism
   in China. Ultimately, this paper underscores a paradigm shift towards
   the datafication of feminist narratives, connecting the contextual realm
   to the relational dynamics of data science for her social good.},

Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},
Number = {9},
Pages = {4667-4681},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The integration of visualizations and text is commonly found in data
   news, analytical reports, and interactive documents. For example,
   financial articles are presented along with interactive charts to show
   the changes in stock prices on Yahoo Finance. Visualizations enhance the
   perception of facts in the text while the text reveals insights of
   visual representation. However, effectively combining text and
   visualizations is challenging and tedious, which usually involves
   advanced programming skills. This paper proposes a semi-automatic
   pipeline that builds links between text and visualization. To resolve
   the relationship between text and visualizations, we present a method
   which structures a visualization and the underlying data as a contextual
   knowledge graph, based on which key phrases in the text are extracted,
   grouped, and mapped with visual elements. To support flexible
   customization of text-visualization links, our pipeline incorporates
   user knowledge to revise the links in a mixed-initiative manner. To
   demonstrate the usefulness and the versatility of our method, we
   replicate prior studies or cases in crafting interactive word-sized
   visualizations, annotating visualizations, and creating text-chart
   interactions based on a prototype system. We carry out two preliminary
   model tests and a user study and the results and user feedbacks suggest
   our method is effective.},

Volume = {21},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Narrative sensemaking is a fundamental process to understand sequential
   information. Narrative maps are a visual representation framework that
   can aid analysts in their narrative sensemaking process. Narrative maps
   allow analysts to understand the big picture of a narrative, uncover new
   relationships between events, and model the connection between
   storylines. We seek to understand how analysts create and use narrative
   maps in order to obtain design guidelines for an interactive
   visualization tool for narrative maps that can aid analysts in narrative
   sensemaking. We perform two experiments with a data set of news
   articles. The insights extracted from our studies can be used to design
   narrative maps, extraction algorithms, and visual analytics tools to
   support the narrative sensemaking process. The contributions of this
   paper are three-fold: (1) an analysis of how analysts construct
   narrative maps; (2) a user evaluation of specific narrative map
   features; and (3) design guidelines for narrative maps. Our findings
   suggest ways for designing narrative maps and extraction algorithms, as
   well as providing insights toward useful interactions. We discuss these
   insights and design guidelines and reflect on the potential challenges
   involved. As key highlights, we find that narrative maps should avoid
   redundant connections that can be inferred by using the transitive
   property of event connections, reducing the overall complexity of the
   map. Moreover, narrative maps should use multiple types of cognitive
   connections between events such as topical and causal connections, as
   this emulates the strategies that analysts use in the narrative
   sensemaking process.},

Abstract = {A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet
   psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that
   these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to
   communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around
   half a million Reddit posts in the sub -communities specialised in 14
   medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep -learning framework.
   In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions
   with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work
   designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from
   the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug
   prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To
   finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological,
   psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a
   narrative -style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study
   involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a
   considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held
   opinions: 10\% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of
   medical conditions, and 27\% were more favourable to the use of social
   media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive
   elements in interactive visualizations.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Data video is an increasingly popular genre of narrative visualization.
   To distill a data story into a video, designers need to draft a sequence
   of data facts and visually connect them by animated transitions. Such
   animated transitions are critical for illustrating data changes and
   enhancing narrative coherence; however, their design still lacks
   systematic guidance. To fill this gap, we developed a design space by
   collecting and analyzing 89 high-quality data videos. The design space
   characterizes the design of animated transitions under three dimensions:
   narrative relation, data change, and transition animation. We conducted
   an online design workshop with 14 participants to evaluate the
   effectiveness of our design space on designing transitions. The results
   show that the design patterns summarized in our design space can be used
   to efficiently guide the transition designs in data videos.},

Title = {Storytelling the war. Social media listening as a transmedia resource in
   the context of the algorithmic turn},
Journal = {H-ERMES-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {55-86},
Abstract = {In the context of the hybrid media system, the transmedia author
   develops his or her creative action through social platforms
   characterized by programmability, popularity, connectivity, and
   datafication (van Dijck \& Poell, 2013). Such logics may constitute a
   limitation for the author with respect to the ability to manage the
   fruition of the content once it is placed on algorithmic platforms.
   However, they also open up new opportunities for listening to user
   engagement. This is important for transmedia storytelling of
   controversial issues such as war that could trigger polarization or
   rejection by connected audiences. From the perspective of production,
   film and television content that addresses such issues involves longer
   planning time frames than the social campaigns that will accompany
   distribution. For these, it becomes crucial for the transmedia author to
   analyze the ongoing debate on the topic of the primary text, so as to
   positively influence the online reception of the audiovisual work.
   Drawing from the analysis of transmedia projects on the wars of the new
   millennium, the essay identifies a crucial transitional phase in which
   social media assume an increasingly relevant role in the design of
   engagement. This context distinguishes the methodological approach to
   social listening based on digital methods and critical metrics (Rogers,
   2019, Stewart \& Arnold, 2018) described in the essay. The proposal aims
   to move beyond net-nographic or quantitative approaches to the analysis
   of interactions in social media to delineate ``listening{''} as a
   resource not only for devising resonant engagement strategies with
   respect to the storytelling of war, but as a practice that can optimize
   transmedia design cycles.},

Abstract = {Combining data content with visual embellishments, infographics can
   effectively deliver messages in an engaging and memorable manner.
   Various authoring tools have been proposed to facilitate the creation of
   infographics. However, creating a professional infographic with these
   authoring tools is still not an easy task, requiring much time and
   design expertise. Therefore, these tools are generally not attractive to
   casual users, who are either unwilling to take time to learn the tools
   or lacking in proper design expertise to create a professional
   infographic. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: to
   automatically generate infographics from natural language statements. We
   first conducted a preliminary study to explore the design space of
   infographics. Based on the preliminary study, we built a
   proof-of-concept system that automatically converts statements about
   simple proportion-related statistics to a set of infographics with
   pre-designed styles. Finally, we demonstrated the usability and
   usefulness of the system through sample results, exhibits, and expert
   reviews.},

Abstract = {Visual designs can be complex in modern data visualization systems,
   which poses special challenges for explaining them to the non-experts.
   However, few if any presentation tools are tailored for this purpose. In
   this study, we present Narvis, a slideshow authoring tool designed for
   introducing data visualizations to non-experts. Narvis targets two types
   of end users: teachers, experts in data visualization who produce
   tutorials for explaining a data visualization, and students, non-experts
   who try to understand visualization designs through tutorials. We
   present an analysis of requirements through close discussions with the
   two types of end users. The resulting considerations guide the design
   and implementation of Narvis. Additionally, to help teachers better
   organize their introduction slideshows, we specify a data visualization
   as a hierarchical combination of components, which are automatically
   detected and extracted by Narvis. The teachers craft an introduction
   slideshow through first organizing these components, and then explaining
   them sequentially. A series of templates are provided for adding
   annotations and animations to improve efficiency during the authoring
   process. We evaluate Narvis through a qualitative analysis of the
   authoring experience, and a preliminary evaluation of the generated
   slideshows.},

   China Central Television Europe depicts Brexit as a hashtag movement
   displayed on an animated bubble chart. However, creating such a story is
   usually laborious and tedious, because narrators have to switch between
   different tools and discuss with different collaborators. To reduce the
   burden, we develop a prototype system to help explore the bubbles'
   movement by automatically inserting animations connected to the
   storytelling of the video creators and the interaction of viewers to
   those videos. We demonstrate the usability of our method through both
   use cases and a semi-structured user study.},

Title = {A Geo-Social Characterization of Health Impact from Air Pollution in
   Mexico Valley},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {The impact of the air pollution phenomenon has been long studied, but
   most often with a fragmented approach, without closely looking at the
   relationship between different components that characterize it, such as
   sensor-based data, health data from institutional databases, and data on
   how it is perceived by human beings in social media. The research
   developed in this study introduces an integrated methodological
   framework that analyses sensor data on air pollution distributed in
   space and time, combined with health data and social data narratives
   that reflect how different communities perceive this phenomenon in space
   and time; exploring how these different heterogeneous sources can be
   combined to better understand the impact of air pollution phenomena at
   the large-city level in the Valley of Mexico. We introduce a
   Spatio-temporal data integration and mining framework that aims to
   discover trends and insights regarding the distribution of the impact of
   an air pollution phenomenon in terms of human health and perception. The
   main peculiarity of our methodological framework is the integration of
   different large data sources by combining a series of methods: NLP
   (topic modeling), data mining (data cubes, unsupervised learning, and
   clustering), and GIS capabilities (spatial interpolation, choropleth
   maps) that together provide a better understanding of the quantitative
   and qualitative patterns emerging at a different spatial scale and
   temporal granularity. Overall, this shows how social data, when combined
   with quantitative data, can provide a better understanding of the impact
   of a given phenomenon, such as air pollution.},

Title = {``It's a Good Idea to Put It Into Words{''}: Writing `Rudders' in the
   Initial Stages of Visualization Design},

Abstract = {Written language is a useful tool for non-visual creative activities
   like composing essays and planning searches. This paper investigates the
   integration of written language into the visualization design process.
   We create the idea of a `writing rudder,' which acts as a guiding force
   or strategy for the designer. Via an interview study of 24 working
   visualization designers, we first established that only a minority of
   participants systematically use writing to aid in design. A second study
   with 15 visualization designers examined four different variants of
   written rudders: asking questions, stating conclusions, composing a
   narrative, and writing titles. Overall, participants had a positive
   reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down
   components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach
   in future design work. More specifically, two approaches - writing
   questions and writing conclusions/takeaways - were seen as beneficial
   across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise
   mainly for the creation stage. Although concerns around potential bias
   during data exploration were raised, participants also discussed
   strategies to mitigate such concerns. This paper contributes to a deeper
   understanding of the interplay between language and visualization, and
   proposes a straightforward, lightweight addition to the visualization
   design process.},

Abstract = {Fact sheets with vivid graphical design and intriguing statistical
   insights are prevalent for presenting raw data. They help audiences
   understand data-related facts effectively and make a deep impression.
   However, designing a fact sheet requires both data and design expertise
   and is a laborious and time-consuming process. One needs to not only
   understand the data in depth but also produce intricate graphical
   representations. To assist in the design process, we present DataShot
   which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated system that
   creates fact sheets automatically from tabular data. First, we conduct a
   qualitative analysis of 245 infographic examples to explore general
   infographic design space at both the sheet and element levels. We
   identify common infographic structures, sheet layouts, fact types, and
   visualization styles during the study. Based on these findings, we
   propose a fact sheet generation pipeline, consisting of fact extraction,
   fact composition, and presentation synthesis, for the auto-generation
   workflow. To validate our system, we present use cases with three
   real-world datasets. We conduct an in-lab user study to understand the
   usage of our system. Our evaluation results show that DataShot can
   efficiently generate satisfactory fact sheets to support further
   customization and data presentation.},

Abstract = {With the development of ICT, numerous digital practices and tools have
   emerged, which at first glance appear to be means of ``care of the
   Self{''}, but a critical stance often reveals their disciplinary nature.
   The aim of this article is to suggest a criterion that distinguishes
   latent disciplinary `` technologies of the Self{''} from genuinely
   productive and emancipatory digital practices of self-transformation. I
   examine the practice of data analysis as a technologically mediated,
   motivated epistemic practice, which, in my opinion, fits within
   Foucault's concept of ``care of the Self{''}. This is maintained by my
   experience of conducting data literacy bootcamps, which showed that
   working with data has a potential for agency development. As to the
   accessibility of data analysis practices, I see that they have long
   extended beyond IT companies, becoming available to the public in a
   variety of contexts, from data journalism to data literacy education
   programs for teenagers. Data analysis as a digital practice is examined
   within the framework of Andrew Pickering's account of scientific
   practices as ``dance of agencies{''}. Pickering argues that human agency
   and disciplinary (discursive) agency are not separate or distinct but
   are rather intertwined and co-constitutive. The researcher constructs
   data-driven narratives that allow them to position themselves in
   relation to the data and phenomena that are publicly represented through
   them, and to reconfigure power/knowledge discourses accordingly. To
   distinguish between disciplinary and genuinely self-transformative
   ``technologies of the Self{''}, I propose a two-stage Productive Action
   concept suggested by Boris Elkonin within cultural-historical
   psychology. The result of fulfilled productive action is a change of
   one's local ontological model. I demonstrate how productive action in
   digital educational practice can contribute to the development of
   students' personally significant ontologies. The special significance of
   working with social and humanitarian data as a prerequisite of such an
   outcome is discussed. The article was prepared as a part of the
   state-assigned research work of the Russian Presidential Academy of
   National Economy and Public Administration.},

   approach. From October 2020 to December 2020, Flow's Covid-19 AR videos
   captured 9 million (9,000,000) views, and have been used in multiple
   professional presentations. This paper documents the journey from
   development to deployment, and some user feedback which all led to

Abstract = {Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data
   stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data
   videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an
   intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the
   underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands
   a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor,
   including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with
   narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio
   narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify
   this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data
   Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with
   narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical
   barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To
   enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references
   between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts
   data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes
   large language models to form semantic connections between text and
   visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as
   computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of
   suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced
   by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy
   through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The
   evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate
   high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.},

Abstract = {As online news increasingly include data journalism, there is a
   corresponding increase in the incorporation of visualization in article
   thumbnail images. However, little research exists on the design
   rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping,
   simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the
   associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these
   design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail
   inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization
   thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail
   practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on
   the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for
   visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of
   visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study
   results indicate that different chart components play different roles in
   attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of
   the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design
   strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a
   data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with
   text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails.
   Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow
   effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles.
   Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured
   guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories.},

Abstract = {Data videos are a highly impactful method of communication and are
   becoming a prevalent medium for communicating information. While the
   majority of current research focuses on the cinematic aspects of data
   videos, very little is known about the narrative methodologies involved.
   This paper presents our insights derived from an initial exploration of
   this area. We present a taxonomy based on the analysis of 70 existing
   data videos examining their narrative and visual approaches. We propose
   that our taxonomy can be used to explain the characteristics or design
   of data videos. Applying this taxonomy, we present our observations,
   including the trend of popular technologies applied in current data
   videos, the under-utilization of promising methods, and highlight
   research opportunities in the field. (C) 2019 Zhejiang University and

Abstract = {Communication-minded visualizations are designed to provide their

   Authoring such visualizations effectively is challenging because the

   present a novel summarized line graph visualization technique designed
   specifically for data analysts to communicate data to decision-makers
   more effectively and efficiently. Our summarized line graph reduces a
   large and detailed dataset of multiple quantitative time-series into (1)
   representative data that provides a quick takeaway of the full dataset;
   (2) analytical highlights that distinguish specific insights of
   interest; and (3) a data envelope that summarizes the remaining
   aggregated data. Our summarized line graph achieved the best overall
   results when evaluated against line graphs, band graphs, stream graphs,
   and horizon graphs on four representative tasks.},

Abstract = {The medical domain has been an inspiring application area in
   visualization research for many years already, but many open challenges
   remain. The driving forces of medical visualization research have been
   strengthened by novel developments, for example, in deep learning, the
   advent of affordable VR technology, and the need to provide medical
   visualizations for broader audiences. At IEEE VIS 2020, we hosted an
   Application Spotlight session to highlight recent medical visualization
   research topics. With this article, we provide the visualization
   community with ten such open challenges, primarily focused on challenges
   related to the visualization of medical imaging data. We first describe
   the unique nature of medical data in terms of data preparation, access,
   and standardization. Subsequently, we cover open visualization research
   challenges related to uncertainty, multimodal and multiscale approaches,
   and evaluation. Finally, we emphasize challenges related to users
   focusing on explainable AI, immersive visualization, P4 medicine, and
   narrative visualization.},

Title = {Narrative Player: Reviving Data Narratives With Visuals},

Abstract = {Data-rich documents are commonly found across various fields such as
   business, finance, and science. However, a general limitation of these
   documents for reading is their reliance on text to convey data and
   facts. Visual representation of text aids in providing a satisfactory
   reading experience in comprehension and engagement. However, existing
   work emphasizes presenting the insights within phrases or sentences,
   rather than fully conveying data stories within the whole paragraphs and
   engaging readers. To provide readers with satisfactory data stories,
   this paper presents Narrative Player, a novel method that automatically
   revives data narratives with consistent and contextualized visuals.
   Specifically, it accepts a paragraph and corresponding data table as
   input and leverages LLMs to characterize the clauses and extract
   contextualized data facts. Subsequently, the facts are transformed into
   a coherent visualization sequence with a carefully designed
   optimization-based approach. Animations are also assigned between
   adjacent visualizations to enable seamless transitions. Finally, the
   visualization sequence, transition animations, and audio narration
   generated by text-to-speech technologies are rendered into a data video.
   The evaluation results showed that the automatic-generated data videos
   were well-received by participants and experts for enhancing reading.},

   Methods to Translate Radio Production to Interaction Design},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a first-person, retrospective exploration of two radio
   sonification pieces that employ narrative scaffolding to teach audiences
   how to listen to data. To decelerate and articulate design processes
   that occurred at the rapid pace of radio production, the sound designer
   and producer wrote retrospective design accounts. We then revisited the
   radio pieces through principles drawn from guidance design, data
   storytelling, visualization literacy, and sound studies. Finally, we
   speculated how these principles might be applied through interactive,
   voice-based technologies. First-person methods enabled us to access the
   implicit knowledge embedded in radio production and translate it to
   technologies of interest to the human-computer-interaction community,
   such as voice user interfaces that rely on auditory display.
   Traditionally, sonification practitioners have focused more on
   generating sounds than on teaching people how to listen; our process,
   however, treated sound and narrative as a holistic, sonic-narrative
   experience. Our first-person retrospection illuminated the role of
   narrative in designing to support people as they learn to listen to
   data.},

Title = {A mixed methods analysis of a yearlong intercultural competence
   curriculum strand},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: In a published 2016 report, it was estimated that
   approximately 80\% of public-school teachers identified as White (United
   States Department of Education 2016). The duality of the issue is that
   the diversity of the teacher workforce has improved since 1990 but lags
   in comparison to the increasing diversity of the student population
   {[}Gumber, C., and J. Beckhusen. 2022. ``U.S. Teachers More Diverse but
   Still Lag Student Racial, Ethnic Makeup{''}. United States Census
   Bureau, January 5. Accessed August 12, 2022.
   https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/01/nations-teachers-more-div
   erse-but-still-lag-racial-ethnic-makeup-of-students.html.]. The
   discrepancy that exists in racial or ethnic diversity between teachers
   and students has been termed a cultural gap {[}Muschell, L. H., and H.
   M. Roberts. 2011. ``Bridging the Cultural Gap: One Teacher Education
   Program's Response to Preparing Culturally Responsive Teachers.{''}
   Childhood Education 87 (5): 337-340.
   https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.2011.10523209]. The value proposition
   for a teacher workforce that mirrors society is hard to dispute. In the
   broadest sense, members of the education sector must coordinate efforts
   to recruit and retain culturally diverse teachers. While these efforts
   are critical, progress will likely be carried out over a longer period
   of time. Thus, adequately preparing current and future teachers to
   bridge the cultural gap is essential.Purpose: Intercultural competence
   (ICC) is an increasingly relevant topic for teacher preparation
   programs. To date, there remains a relative dearth of research on
   strategies that physical education teacher education (PETE) programs can
   use to promote ICC among teacher candidates (TCs). This study aimed to
   explore a yearlong curriculum strand's impact on promoting ICC
   development in TCs.Methods: A mixed methods research design involving
   quantitative and qualitative data collection was employed. The
   quantitative measure was the Intercultural Development Inventory (R).
   Qualitative measures consisted of journal entries and semi-structured
   interviews. Datasets were then merged to generate mixed-data narratives.
   Participants included 29 TCs enrolled at a mid-Atlantic
   University.Findings: Analyses revealed that the curriculum strand did
   not promote significant change in teacher candidates' ICC levels
   quantitatively. Researchers used the constant comparison method to
   interpret the mixed data narratives. Analyses of the mixed data
   narratives revealed four emergent themes: (a) experience with cultural
   diversity; (b) confidence to teach culturally diverse students; (c)
   making sense of ICC; and (d) reflection on action.Conclusions:
   Participant data suggests that ICC is a topic that TCs value but may be
   lacking in their practical, applied understanding of working across
   cultural differences. Implications and future research on promoting ICC
   among physical education TCs are discussed. To our knowledge, this study
   will be the first application of the IDI (R) to explore change following
   physical education TCs' participation in a yearlong curriculum strand
   focused on promoting ICC.},

Journal = {GEOGRAFIE},

Volume = {124},

Pages = {217-235},
Abstract = {Atlases have a long tradition of showing and linking information for the
   exploration of various mostly spatially related topics. The Atlas of the
   Ageing Society is an interactive platform illustrating age related data.
   It enables individuals to explore facts and information related to age
   and the ageing society. To support content representation as well as a
   diverse audience, we developed the ``story network principle{''}, which
   embeds annotated visualizations into a network of information in order
   to allow storytelling with data. Enabling the exploration of such a
   multifaceted and highly interconnected data landscape, however, posed
   some technical challenges. This paper describes and discusses a back-end
   implementation that meets the requirements of the story network
   principle from a technical perspective. We detail and exemplify the
   design and implementation of the atlas infrastructure to enable others
   to benefit from our developments and approaches to the challenges. The
   story network principle is potentially applicable to a range of
   applications such as other atlases or digital portfolios.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Visual data stories have been shown to significantly aid the
   comprehension and short-term memorability of statistical facts and value
   messages. Hence, they are a promising medium for communicating complex
   information to a target audience, fulfilling the communicative goal of
   information visualisation. However, creating visual data stories often
   requires a plethora of tools to execute the visual data story creation
   process - creating visualisations, developing a logical connection
   between visualisations, and presenting the story based on the
   meaningfully sequenced visualisations. Current information visualisation
   tools either focus primarily on exploration or lack sequencing models
   for visualisation presentation, even though transitioning and sequencing
   have been shown to affect user understanding and interpretation of
   visualisations. We present Gravity, a system that consolidates the
   different phases of the visual data story creation process, and
   recommends and visualises logically sequenced sets of interactive
   visualisations to support the presentation of coherent narratives and
   visual data stories. We also report on an evaluation study with
   representative participants. Our results show that participants learned
   to use the system within a short time and successfully created visual
   data stories with minimal guidance.},

Abstract = {There are many multiple-stage racing competitions in various sports such
   as swimming, running, or cycling. The wide availability of affordable
   tracking devices facilitates monitoring the position along with the race
   of all participants, even for non-professional contests. Getting
   real-time information of contenders is useful but also unleashes the
   possibility of creating more complex visualization systems that ease the
   understanding of the behavior of all participants during a simple stage
   or throughout the whole competition. In this paper we focus on bicycle
   races, which are highly popular, especially in Europe, being the Tour de
   France its greatest exponent. Current visualizations from TV
   broadcasting or real-time tracking websites are useful to understand the
   current stage status, up to a certain extent. Unfortunately, still no
   current system exists that visualizes a whole multi-stage contest in
   such a way that users can interactively explore the relevant events of a
   single stage (e.g. breakaways, groups, virtual leadership horizontal
   ellipsis ), as well as the full competition. In this paper, we present
   an interactive system that is useful both for aficionados and
   professionals to visually analyze the development of multi-stage cycling
   competitions.},

Abstract = {The design of visual narrative products and the expression of visual
   representations in videos are typically carried out independently,
   resulting in a lack of unified logic and systematic organization in
   multi-dimensional, multi-scale and multi-scenario narrative maps. To
   address this issue, this research project applies the concept of
   conceptual story model to the design of narrative map products and uses
   the hand-rolled map as a carrier to design an interactive narrative
   system. It utilizes a three-level model based on emotional design theory
   to design narrative videos and employs narrative theory to organize the
   storyline of the Nanjing Ming City Wall (NMCW). The experimental and
   statistical results show that the proposed method effectively represents
   the historical and cultural characteristics of the NMCW, aiding
   participants' understanding and supporting public dissemination of
   historical knowledge. It contributes to the multidimensional
   representation of historical scenes, enhancing public awareness and
   encouraging participation in cultural heritage conservation.},

Abstract = {In this paper I draw on my experiences of listening to migrant and
   refugee women's stories of displacement and explore questions around
   discourses and practices of listening across borders and languages. In
   doing so, I particularly focus on the materiality of listening, the
   force of corporeal voices, the rhythms of oral narratives and their
   effects on understanding and making connections within the web of human
   relations. Following tracks and traces of a rich body of literature
   around sounds, voices and texts in narrative analytics and feminist
   theory, I have turned my attention to aurality and I have suggested
   narrative rhythmanalysis as a mode of understanding and as a method.
   What I argue is that turning our attention to listening practices as a
   neglected process in theoretical analysis illuminates the perspective of
   the storyteller, mobilizes affective forces in the milieu of relational
   narratives and enacts the materiality of knowledge through the intensity
   and uniqueness of the corporeal voice. What I finally suggest is that
   perhaps we should move beyond the imperatives of clarity and
   transparency in an attempt to be in the world with others. Here the
   sound of narratives could become a trope that can take us down the path
   of decolonizing our ways of knowing and understanding.},

Title = {Viewpoint Selection for 3D Scenes in Map Narratives},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Narrative mapping, an advanced geographic information visualization
   technology, presents spatial information episodically, enhancing
   readers' spatial understanding and event cognition. However, during 3D
   scene construction, viewpoint selection is heavily reliant on the
   cartographer's subjective interpretation of the event. Even with
   fixed-angle settings, the task of ensuring that selected viewpoints
   align with the narrative theme remains challenging. To address this, an
   automated viewpoint selection method constrained by narrative relevance
   and visual information is proposed. Narrative relevance is determined by
   calculating spatial distances between each element and the thematic
   element within the scene. Visual information is quantified by assessing
   the visual salience of elements as the ratio of their projected area on
   the view window to their total area. Pearson's correlation coefficient
   is used to evaluate the relationship between visual salience and
   narrative relevance, serving as a constraint to construct a viewpoint
   fitness function that integrates the visual salience of the convex
   polyhedron enclosing the scene. The chaotic particle swarm optimization
   (CPSO) algorithm is utilized to locate the viewpoint position while
   maximizing the fitness function, identifying a viewpoint meeting
   narrative and visual salience requirements. Experimental results
   indicate that, compared to the maximum projected area method and
   fixed-value method, a higher viewpoint fitness is achieved by this
   approach. The narrative views generated by this method were positively
   recognized by approximately two-thirds of invited professionals. This
   process aligns effectively with narrative visualization needs, enhances
   3D narrative map creation efficiency, and offers a robust strategy for
   viewpoint selection in 3D scene-based narrative mapping.},

Abstract = {Tracking the sensemaking process is a well-established practice in many
   data analysis tools, and many visualization tools facilitate overview
   and recall during and after exploration. However, the resulting
   communication materials such as presentations or infographics often omit
   provenance information for the sake of simplicity. This unfortunately
   limits later viewers from engaging in further collaborative sensemaking
   or discussion about the analysis. We present a design study where we
   introduced visual provenance and analytics to urban transportation
   planning. Maintaining the provenance of all analyses was critical to
   support collaborative sensemaking among the many and diverse
   stakeholders. Our system, STORYFACETS, exposes several different views
   of the same analysis session, each view designed for a specific
   audience: (1) the trail view provides a data flow canvas that supports
   in-depth exploration + provenance (expert analysts); (2) the dashboard
   view organizes visualizations and other content into a space-filling
   layout to support high-level analysis (managers); and (3) the slideshow
   view supports linear storytelling via interactive step-by-step
   presentations (laypersons). Views are linked so that when one is
   changed, provenance is maintained. Visual provenance is available on
   demand to support iterative sensemaking for any team member.},

Abstract = {Decades of research have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at
   estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that are inherent
   in Bayesian reasoning problems. Yet in the medical domain, both
   physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on
   conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts
   to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports
   of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even
   contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals
   being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6\%
   to 62\%. In this work, we show that problem representation can
   significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of
   information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and
   visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as
   77\%. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability,
   our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100\%. By
   and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent
   reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant
   improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can
   have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields.},

Abstract = {There are many ways to visualize event sequences as timelines. In a
   storytelling context where the intent is to convey multiple narrative
   points, a richer set of timeline designs may be more appropriate than
   the narrow range that has been used for exploratory data analysis by the
   research community. Informed by a survey of 263 timelines, we present a
   design space for storytelling with timelines that balances
   expressiveness and effectiveness, identifying 14 design choices
   characterized by three dimensions: representation, scale, and layout.
   Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that
   can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated
   transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a
   cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and
   data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full
   set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept
   sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline
   stories. Ultimately, this work is intended to inform and inspire the
   design of future tools for storytelling with timelines.},

Abstract = {The Sound of Water (https://flow-mer.org.au/napnap) microsite documents
   an environmental intervention at Nap Nap Swamp, a wetland in the western
   reaches of Australia's Murrumbidgee River. A collaboration between a
   designer (Whitelaw) and an ecologist (Wassens), it was supported by the
   Commonwealth Environmental Water Office. We use audiovisual data
   storytelling to engage audiences with Nap Nap as it transitions from a
   dry to wet state. Focusing on a 9-day period in mid-2020, we combine
   audio and hydrological data to show the ecosystem's response to a
   managed environmental flow, narrating this change through the wetland's
   charismatic frog species, including the threatened Southern Bell Frog.
   In this paper we reflect on the technical and creative contributions of
   the project in visualising environmental audio, as well as its
   significance for wider practice. We highlight the value of creatively
   re-purposing ecological data and the importance of multi-stakeholder
   networks, and we argue that our celebration in this project of
   environmental management, intervention and care should be a key concern
   for future digital ecologies practices.},

Volume = {29},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Previous research has shown that various user characteristics (e.g.,
   cognitive abilities, personality traits, and learning abilities) can
   influence user experience during information visualization tasks. These
   findings have prompted researchers to investigate user-adaptive
   information visualizations that can help users by providing personalized
   support based on their specific needs. Whereas existing work has been
   mostly limited to tasks involving just visualizations, the aim of our
   research is to broaden this work to include scenarios where users
   process textual documents with embedded visualizations, i.e., Magazine
   Style Narrative Visualizations, or MSNVs for short. In this paper, we
   analyze eye tracking data collected from a user study with MSNVs to
   uncover processing behaviors that are negatively impacting user
   experience (i.e., time on task) for users with low abilities in these
   user characteristics. Our analysis leverages Linear Mixed-Effects Models
   to evaluate the relationships among user characteristics, gaze
   processing behaviors, and task performance. Our results identify several
   MSNV processing behaviors within the visualization that contribute to
   poor task performance for users with low reading proficiency. For
   instance, we identify that users with low reading proficiency transition
   significantly more often compared to their counterparts between relevant
   and non-relevant bars, and transition more often from bars to the
   labels. We present our findings as a step toward designing user-adaptive
   support mechanisms to alleviate these difficulties with MSNVs, and
   provide suggestions on how our results can be leveraged for creating a
   set of meaningful interventions for future evaluation (e.g., dynamically
   highlighting relevant bars and labels in the visualization to help users
   with low reading proficiency locate them more effectively).},

Abstract = {Extracting data insights and generating visual data stories from tabular
   data are critical parts of data analysis. However, most existing studies
   primarily focus on tabular data stored as flat tables, typically without
   leveraging the relations between cells in the headers of hierarchical
   tables. When properly used, rich table headers can enable the extraction
   of many additional data stories. To assist analysts in visual data
   storytelling, an approach is needed to organize these data insights
   efficiently. In this work, we propose CoInsight, a system to facilitate
   visual storytelling for hierarchical tables by connecting insights.
   CoInsight extracts data insights from hierarchical tables and builds
   insight relations according to the structure of table headers. It
   further visualizes related data insights using a nested graph with edge
   bundling. We evaluate the CoInsight system through a usage scenario and
   a user experiment. The results demonstrate the utility and usability of
   CoInsight for converting data insights in hierarchical tables into
   visual data stories.},

Title = {Workflow and tools to track and visualize behavioural data from a
   Virtual Reality environment using a lightweight GIS},
Journal = {SOFTWAREX},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUL-DEC},
Abstract = {Evaluating user behaviour in Virtual Reality is a challenge for every
   researcher involved in designing and executing experiments in immersive
   environments. Behavioural information could lead to relevant findings in
   presence, engagement or, for example, the mood of the player during a VR
   experience. Saving this kind of information and exploding it in an
   appropriate way could lead researchers or even game designers to
   identify relevant behavioural patterns or correlations. In this article,
   we are proposing a simple, replicable workflow and a set of scripted
   tools in order to acquire user's navigational data and visualize it
   using the inherent capabilities of a Geographic Information System. Our
   workflow goes from data acquisition in Unity3D with C\# to the final
   representation in a map using Leaflet, an open-source GIS JavaScript
   based, passing through the pre-processing of XML files. Using a GIS to
   visualize navigational data is a flexible, ecological and effective
   solution that improves productivity and awareness on data storytelling
   capabilities. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Cyber security logs and incident reports describe a narrative, but in
   practice analysts view the data in tables where it can be difficult to
   follow the narrative. Narrative visualizations are useful, but common
   examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story's
   narrative; it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries.
   This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce
   the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a
   user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization
   tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real
   incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false
   positives and improves average precision by 41\% while reducing average
   incident report size up to 79\%. Together, the visualization and
   summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber
   narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate
   that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic
   graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Miserables
   character interaction graph. We find that the list of main characters in
   the automatically generated summary has substantial agreement with
   human-generated summaries. A version of this paper, data, and code is

Abstract = {Vision provides rapid processing for some tasks, but encounters strong
   constraints from others. Although many tasks encounter a capacity limit
   of processing four visual objects at once, some evidence suggests far
   lower limits for processing relationships among objects. What is our
   capacity limit for relational processing? If it is indeed limited, then
   people may miss important relationships between data values in a graph.
   To test this question, we asked people to explore graphs of trivially
   simple 2 x 2 data sets and found that half of the viewers missed
   surprising and improbable relationships (e.g., a child's height
   decreasing over time). These relationships were spotted easily in a
   control condition, which implicitly directed viewers to prioritize
   inspecting the key relationships. Thus, a severe limit on relational
   processing, combined with a cascade of other capacity-limited operations
   (e.g., linking values to semantic content), makes understanding a graph
   more like slowly reading a paragraph then immediately recognizing an
   image. These results also highlight the practical importance of ``data
   storytelling{''} techniques, where communicators design graphs that help
   their audience prioritize the most important relationships in data.},

Abstract = {We conduct an eye tracking study to investigate perception
   text-embellished narrative visualizations under different task
   conditions. Study stimuli are data visualizations embellished with
   text-based elements: annotations, captions, labels, and descriptive
   text. We consider three common viewing tasks that occur when these types
   of graphics are viewed: (1) simple observation, (2) active search to
   answer a query, and (3) information memorization for later recall. The
   overarching goal is to understand, at a perceptual level, if and how
   task affects how these visualizations are interacted with. By analyzing
   collected gaze data and conducting advanced semantic scanpath analysis,
   we find, at a high level, diverse patterns of gaze behavior: simple
   observation and information memorization lead to similar optical viewing

Abstract = {Seaports are experiencing several challenges due to the explosive growth
   of the maritime shipping business, which has led to the need for
   digitalized operations and more effective solutions. This article
   provides a comprehensive exploration of the process used to create a
   reliable business intelligence solution by analyzing the container
   delivery and pick-up services flow in one of Portugal's largest maritime
   container ports, using the CRISP-DM methodology. The solution, built
   with Microsoft Power BI (R), provides the capability to identify and
   address data anomalies and present key performance indicators in
   visually dynamic dashboards. This solution empowers stakeholders to gain
   invaluable insights into the current and future operational status,
   thereby facilitating well-informed and adaptable decision-making,
   representing the main practical contributions. As a theoretical
   contribution, this study advances research by covering a gap in the
   literature and establishing the foundations for future business
   intelligence applications within the maritime industry, with a focus on
   addressing data dispersion challenges, enhancing logistics flow
   analysis, and reducing port congestion. The manuscript is structured
   into seven sections: introduction, literature review, port challenges,
   methodology, tool development, SWOT analysis, and conclusion.},

Abstract = {Onboarding a user to a visualization dashboard entails explaining its
   various components, including the chart types used, the data loaded, and
   the interactions available. Authoring such an onboarding experience is
   time-consuming and requires significant knowledge and little guidance on
   how best to complete this task. Depending on their levels of expertise,
   end users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and
   overwhelmed or disinterested and disengaged. We propose interactive
   dashboard tours (D-Tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences that
   preserve the agency of users with various levels of expertise to keep
   them interested and engaged. Our interactive tours concept draws from
   open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path
   through onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called
   D-TOUR PROTOTYPE, which allows authors to craft custom interactive
   dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically
   generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g.,
   video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an
   onboarding experience tailored to an individual user. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert
   interviews. Our evaluation shows that authors found the automation in
   the D-Tour Prototype helpful and time-saving, and users found the
   created tours engaging and intuitive. This paper and all supplemental
   materials are available at https://osf.io/6fbjp/.},

Title = {Emergency nurses' triage narrative data, their uses and structure: a
   scoping review protocol},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction The first clinical interaction most patients have in the
   emergency department occurs during triage. An unstructured narrative is
   generated during triage and is the first source of in-hospital
   documentation. These narratives capture the patient's reported reason
   for the visit and the initial assessment and offer significantly more
   nuanced descriptions of the patient's complaints than fixed field data.
   Previous research demonstrated these data are useful for predicting
   important clinical outcomes. Previous reviews examined these narratives
   in combination or isolation with other free-text sources, but used
   restricted searches and are becoming outdated. Furthermore, there are no
   reviews focused solely on nurses' (the primary collectors of these data)
   narratives.
   Methods and analysis Using the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review
   framework and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines, we will perform
   structured searches of CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, Ovid
   Embase and Cochrane Library (via Wiley). Additionally, we will forward
   citation searches of all included studies. No geographical or study
   design exclusion criteria will be used. Studies examining disaster
   triage, published before 1990, and non-English language literature will
   be excluded. Data will be managed using online management tools;
   extracted data will be independently confirmed by a separate reviewer
   using prepiloted extraction forms. Cohen's kappa will be used to examine
   inter-rater agreement on pilot and final screening. Quantitative data
   will be expressed using measures of range and central tendency, counts,
   proportions and percentages, as appropriate. Qualitative data will be
   narrative summaries of the authors' primary findings.
   Patient and public involvement No patients involved.
   Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is required. Findings will
   be submitted to peer-reviewed conferences and journals. Results will be
   disseminated using individual and institutional social media platforms.},

Title = {Effect of Adaptive Guidance and Visualization Literacy on Gaze Attentive
   Behaviors and Sequential Patterns on Magazine-Style Narrative
   Visualizations},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3-4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {We study the effectiveness of adaptive interventions at helping users
   process textual documents with embedded visualizations, a form of
   multimodal documents known as Magazine-Style Narrative Visualizations
   (MSNVs). The interventions are meant to dynamically highlight in the
   visualization the datapoints that are described in the textual sentence
   currently being read by the user, as captured by eye-tracking. These
   interventions were previously evaluated in two user studies that
   involved 98 participants reading excerpts of real-world MSNVs during a
   1-hour session. Participants' outcomes included their subjective
   feedback about the guidance, and well as their reading time and score on
   a set of comprehension questions. Results showed that the interventions
   can increase comprehension of the MSNV excerpts for users with lower
   levels of a cognitive skill known as visualization literacy. In this
   article, we aim to further investigate this result by leveraging
   eye-tracking to analyze in depth how the participants processed the
   interventions depending on their levels of visualization literacy. We
   first analyzed summative gaze metrics that capture how users process and
   integrate the key components of the narrative visualizations. Second, we
   mined the salient patterns in the users' scanpaths to contextualize how
   users sequentially process these components. Results indicate that the
   interventions succeed in guiding attention to salient components of the
   narrative visualizations, especially by generating more transitions
   between key components of the visualization (i.e., datapoints, labels,
   and legend), as well as between the two modalities (text and
   visualization). We also show that the interventions help users with
   lower levels of visualization literacy to better map datapoints to the
   legend, which likely contributed to their improved comprehension of the
   documents. These findings shed light on how adaptive interventions help
   users with different levels of visualization literacy, informing the
   design of personalized narrative visualizations.},

   supporting the complete cycle of data narration, from the exploration of

   enough to cover a wide range of crafting practices, and (iii) being well
   founded upon a conceptual model of the domain. In addition, we

Abstract = {Innovation in journalism became an important element to determine the
   current and future direction of the profession. Through incremental and
   cumulative transformations over time, because of many obstacles faced
   inside the newsrooms, journalism has suffered from significant and
   fundamental changes, including the deployment of data journalism. In
   Latin America, the practice has seen an increasing expansion in the last
   years. Nevertheless, there are important technological gaps that limit
   its development. The present study draws upon literature on data
   journalism, media management, and sociology, aiming to contribute
   theoretically to data journalism research. Our findings show that beyond
   the technological approach, practitioners are relying on data
   evangelists, collaboration, and audience-centered innovation to produce
   data storytelling in their newsrooms. On the other hand, these alliances
   form ``homophily{''} and ``endogamy{''} features that limit the
   dissemination of the practice, which must consider the potential
   implications for the social distance of the audiences. It argues that
   Latin American professionals are distancing themselves from
   technological determinism to embrace a more audience-centric innovation
   in newsrooms. Finally, it also states that it is important to take into
   account those limitations, as they pose obstacles for data journalism
   innovation research knowledge. The article concludes with an agenda for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public
   presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the
   domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows
   comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication
   around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive
   briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with
   individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to
   audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit
   our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data
   scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with
   visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a
   retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from
   which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We
   describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small
   collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more
   structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational
   performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or
   customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three
   design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the
   progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a
   narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the
   audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with
   interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses
   surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating
   accessible and engaging audience experiences.},

Abstract = {Although basketball games have received broad attention, the forms of
   game reports and webcast are purely content-based cross-media: texts,
   videos, snapshots, and performance figures. Analytical narrations of
   games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets
   are challenging for general media producers because such a composition
   is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular,
   an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two
   factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game
   events, player locations, player profiles, and team profiles, among
   others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and
   effective basketball game data visualization made up of different
   sources of media. Existing visualizations of basketball games mainly
   profile a particular aspect of the game. Therefore, this paper presents
   an expressive visualization scheme that comprehensively illustrates NBA
   games with three levels of details: a season level, a game level, and a
   session level. We reorganize a basketball game as a sequence of sessions
   to depict the game states and heated confrontations. We design and
   implement a live system that integrates multimedia NBA datasets:
   play-by-play text data, box score data, game video data, and action area
   data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme with case studies
   and user feedbacks.},

Abstract = {Public procurement is a large market affecting almost every organisation
   and individual; therefore, governments need to ensure its efficiency,
   transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive,
   and vibrant economies. In this context, open data initiatives and
   integration of data from multiple sources across national borders could
   transform the procurement market by such as lowering the barriers of
   entry for smaller suppliers and encouraging healthier competition, in
   particular by enabling cross-border bids. Increasingly more open data is
   published in the public sector; however, these are created and
   maintained in siloes and are not straightforward to reuse or maintain
   because of technical heterogeneity, lack of quality, insufficient
   metadata, or missing links to related domains. To this end, we developed
   an open linked data platform, called TheyBuyForYou, consisting of a set
   of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse,
   and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement
   knowledge graph. We developed advanced tools and services on top of the
   knowledge graph for anomaly detection, cross-lingual document search,
   and data storytelling. This article describes the TheyBuyForYou platform
   and knowledge graph, reports their adoption by different stakeholders
   and challenges and experiences we went through while creating them, and
   demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies
   for enhancing public procurement.},

Abstract = {There is growing interest in creating learning analytics feedback
   interfaces that support students directly. While dashboards and other
   visualizations are proliferating, the evidence is that many fail to
   provide meaningful insights that help students reflect productively. The
   contribution of this article is qualitative and quantitative evidence
   from two studies evaluating a multimodal teamwork analytics tool in
   authentic clinical teamwork simulations. Collocated activity data are
   rendered to help nursing students reflect on errors and stress-related
   incidents during simulations. The user interface explicitly guides
   student reflection using data storytelling principles, tuned to the
   intended learning outcomes. The results demonstrate the potential of
   interfaces that ``tell one data story at a time,{''} by helping students
   to identify misconceptions and errors; think about strategies they might
   use to address errors, and reflect on their arousal levels. The results
   also illuminate broader issues around automated formative assessment,
   and the intelligibility and accountability of learning analytics.},

Abstract = {A growing number of scientific publications is available to promote
   sustainable river management. However, these publications target
   researchers rather than water management professionals who are
   responsible for the implementation of management practices. To bridge
   this science-to-practice gap, we conceptualize and propose a series of
   steps to prepare effective storylines targeted at a practitioner
   audience. We developed this approach within a research program that
   supports integrated and collaborative river management. We prepared
   three storylines, each based on one scientific publication. The
   storylines combined text and interactive visuals using the ESRI
   StoryMaps tool to make them available online. Via focus groups with 44
   participants from research and practice, we evaluated the perceived
   usefulness of and engagement with the content and design. We collected
   feedback from participants using a survey as well as via audio and
   screen recordings. Our findings show that we should narrow down the
   audience of the storylines by tailoring them to the needs of project
   managers rather than specialized advisors. Therefore, the content should
   offer more than a visual summary of the research by showing examples of
   the management application. A more engaging sequence with a clear
   protagonist is further required to better relate to the problem and the
   potential application. Although visuals and interactive elements were
   considered attractive, a multi-disciplinary editorial team is necessary
   to better complement the visuals' design to the text. The level of
   detail of participants' feedback shows that involving project managers
   to co-create storylines can be an important step for improvement.},

Title = {Intergroup Dialogue Empowering Action for Transforming Equity in Higher
   Education},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As universities grapple with contentious socio-political climates,
   promoting intergroup relations efforts remains critical in mitigating
   these conflicts. Intergroup dialogue (IGD) provides one approach to
   improving intergroup relations in higher education. Prior evidence
   suggests that IGD reduces prejudice, increases empathy, builds critical
   consciousness, and improves intergroup relations. However, scant studies
   document virtual and multi-site IGD, especially those that include
   varied stakeholders. The current study sought to close these gaps by
   offering a facilitated and sustained four-stage model of IGD that
   concluded with collaborative action projects. A total of 32 students,
   faculty, and staff from eight universities in California participated in
   a virtual 20-hour, two-semester IGD program aimed to (1) generate
   dialogue around systemic barriers to graduation and (2) create action
   projects that address equity issues. Pre- and post-surveys with 22
   participants showed increased intergroup empathy, improved comfort in
   having difficult conversations, and increased interest in future action
   behaviors. The participants also developed 10 action projects aimed at
   closing equity gaps through data storytelling, resource dissemination,
   dialogue programming, and policy advocacy. Our study adds to the
   effectiveness of IGD in higher education, offers important lessons
   learned, and highlights the implications of this work for both IGD
   practitioners and universities.},

Abstract = {Our life stories evolve in specific and contextualized places. Although
   our households may be our primarily shaping environment, our
   neighborhoods expose us to the immediate ``real world{''} outside home.
   Indeed, the places where we are currently experiencing and have
   experienced life play fundamental roles in the development of our
   identities, beliefs, fears, perceptions of the world, and even in the
   (mis)understanding of our prospects of social mobility. Despite the
   analytic benefits that knowledge of the places and contexts where we
   experience life brings to better understanding our life stories and
   health outcomes, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods researchers
   continue to forego the analytic and elucidating power that
   geo-contextualizing our participants' narratives bring to our analyses,
   research findings, conclusions, and plans of action. From this view
   then, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods research findings and
   conclusions may have been ignoring the spatial contexts that most likely
   have shaped the experiences of research participants. The main reason
   for the underuse of these geo-contextualized stories is the requirement
   of specialized training in geographical information systems (GIS) and/or
   computer and statistical programming along with the absence of cost-free
   and user-friendly geo-visualization tools that may allow non-GIS experts
   to benefit from geo-contextualized outputs. To address this gap, we
   present GeoStoryTelling, an analytic framework and user-friendly,
   cost-free, multi-platform software that enables researchers to visualize
   their geo-contextualized qualitative narratives. The use of this
   peer-reviewed software (see https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.7385885.v3),
   available in Mac (https://cutt.ly/E724wAx) and Windows
   (https://cutt.ly/J724f0C) operating systems, does not require users to
   learn GIS nor computer/statistical programming to obtain
   state-of-the-art, and visually appealing and interactive maps. These
   resulting HTML visualizations are capable of integrating a variety of
   multi-media inputs that include text, image, videos, sound
   recordings/music, as well as hyperlinks to other websites-see
   https://cutt.ly/k7X9tfN. Since GeoStoryTelling relies on OpenStreetMap,
   its applications may be used worldwide, thus strengthening its potential
   reach to the qualitative, mixed methods, ethnographic, and health
   scientific communities, regardless of location around the world.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF WORKPLACE LEARNING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},
Pages = {549-568},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to examine participants' perspectives in
   organization-sponsored training and provides support for further
   research positioning the trainer as an organizational leader.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The interactions described in the trainees' experiences were examined
   through a social constructivist lens. Interviews were conducted to
   collect data. Narratives were analyzed to reach interpretation.
   Findings
   Interview results identified four themes, namely, relevance and
   applicability of training received, the formation of attitudes and
   preferences among the trainee participants, immediacy in the use of the
   training received and relational and organizational influence that
   furthers leader-member exchange in the workplace.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study examined participants' perspectives in workplace training and
   provides support for further research: examining communication's role in
   workplace learning; exploring the training process; and positioning the
   trainer as an organizational leader.
   Practical implications
   This study provides empirical data to support changes in instructional
   communication models and exploring the process of training. Trainers'
   relational building with trainees could impact many outcomes in their
   training efforts that are detailed in this study.
   Originality/value
   This study uses a collection of methods to address the trainees'
   experience in formal workplace learning. It demonstrates the power of
   trainers to influence what the trainees think of training content,
   format and relational learning.},

Title = {Effect of Designer- versus User-driven Network-monitoring Dashboard
   Design on User Flow Experience and Performance: The Role of Augmented
   Virtuality},
Journal = {INFORMATION \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},
Number = {3},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {A well -designed dashboard can effectively communicate critical
   information to network administrators and enable them to identify and
   solve network issues quickly. However, little is understood about how
   networkmonitoring dashboard designs impact user experience in an
   augmented virtuality (AV) environment. Our study proposes that a
   dashboard design showing variations in selected elements can impact the
   networkmonitoring flow experience of users by affecting their enjoyment,
   concentration, and control, which in turn can influence their
   performance in critical, complex, and time -sensitive environments. To
   investigate this phenomenon, we design and evaluate two narrative
   visualization user interfaces-a designer -driven (DD) design and a user
   -driven (UD) design-in the context of network -monitoring dashboards.
   Adding vivid and familiar realworld objects may enhance perceived
   realism; thus, we integrate AV with the two dashboard designs (i.e., DD
   and UD) and evaluate their effect on user flow experience and
   performance. Results suggest that the flow experience of users will lead
   to positive perceived performance. A nonlinear relationship between AV
   and dashboard design, and the UD design with a moderate AV level can
   improve user flow experience and performance compared with the DD
   design. When the AV level is nonexistent or excessive, the superior
   effect of the UD design disappears. Lastly, we discuss practical
   implications and theoretical contributions, along with future research
   directions.},

Abstract = {Presenting and communicating insights to an audience-telling a story-is
   one of the main goals of data exploration. Even though visualization as
   a storytelling medium has recently begun to gain attention, storytelling
   is still underexplored in information visualization and little research
   has been done to help people tell their stories with data. To create a
   new, more engaging form of storytelling with data, we leverage and
   extend the narrative storytelling attributes of whiteboard animation
   with pen and touch interactions. We present SketchStory, a data-enabled
   digital whiteboard that facilitates the creation of personalized and
   expressive data charts quickly and easily. SketchStory recognizes a
   small set of sketch gestures for chart invocation, and automatically
   completes charts by synthesizing the visuals from the presenter-provided
   example icon and binding them to the underlying data. Furthermore,
   SketchStory allows the presenter to move and resize the completed data
   charts with touch, and filter the underlying data to facilitate
   interactive exploration. We conducted a controlled experiment for both
   audiences and presenters to compare SketchStory with a traditional
   presentation system, Microsoft PowerPoint. Results show that the
   audience is more engaged by presentations done with SketchStory than
   PowerPoint. Eighteen out of 24 audience participants preferred
   SketchStory to PowerPoint. Four out of five presenter participants also
   favored SketchStory despite the extra effort required for presentation.},

Abstract = {Sports clubs and other sports organizations are important to modern
   society because their activities provide important values linked to
   sports. This article focuses on the passive consumption of sports as a
   leisure activity that brings fans joy, a sense of belonging, and other
   values associated with their favourite sport and club. For sports club
   managers to achieve sustainable operation associated with sufficient
   funds obtained from fans, they can apply various ways of involving the
   fans themselves in creating a loyal community and in selected managerial
   issues. The article's aim is to describe the current level of knowledge
   in this area and follow it up with practical recommendations for the
   effective setting of the involvement of fans in selected processes. The
   applied methodology uses several methods, such as case studies, analysis
   of statistical data, storytelling, or the creation of flow charts
   describing the new setting of the processes in question. Data describing
   selected examples from practice and case studies were obtained from
   available Internet sources. However, the research results were
   supplemented by the analysis of data provided by the football
   association, which covers this sport at the national level within the
   Slevensk Republic. The main findings of the presented research include
   the fact that the involvement of fans in sports club management issues
   is often associated with concerns on the part of managers. Therefore, it
   is recommended to plan and implement the successive steps of this
   involvement, starting with involvement in the creation of a loyal fan
   community.},

Title = {Designing a Human-centred Learning Analytics Dashboard In-use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in applying human-centred design methods to
   create learning analytics (LA) systems, most efforts have concentrated
   on initial design phases, with limited exploration of how LA tools and
   practices can co-evolve during the actual learning and teaching
   activities. This paper examines how a human-centred LA dashboard can be
   further refined and adapted by teachers while actively using it in a
   real-world scenario (i.e., design-in-use),beyond its intended design
   (i.e., design-for-use). We use instrumental genesis as a theoretical
   lens to analyze the temporary and permanent instrumentalization of
   design features and individual and collective instrumentation of the LA
   dashboard. The analysis of semi-structured individual interviews with
   five nursing teachers who used an LA dashboard to guide team reflections
   with 224 students (56 teams) revealed technical and pedagogical changes
   that occurred in both the system's features (instrumentalization) and
   teaching practices (instrumentation). We found that teachers adopted the
   LA dashboard beyond initially intended ways by (i) providing emotional
   support with the analytics, (ii) reducing details in AI-powered data
   visualizations for easier comprehension, (iii) creating data narratives
   to address data limitations, and (iv) collectively developing new
   practices to use the LA dashboard for co-teaching. Therefore, teachers'
   design-in-use of the LA dashboard highlights the ongoing need for design
   improvements to address challenges posed by dynamic data and complex
   algorithms underlying AI and analytics interfaces.},

Abstract = {Augmented video presentation tools provide a natural way for presenters
   to interact with their content, resulting in engaging experiences for
   remote audiences, such as when a presenter uses hand gestures to
   manipulate and direct attention to visual aids overlaid on their webcam
   feed. However, authoring and customizing these presentations can be
   challenging, particularly when presenting dynamic data visualization
   (i.e., animated charts). To this end, we introduce VisConductor, an
   authoring and presentation tool that equips presenters with the ability
   to configure gestures that control affect-varying visualization
   animation, foreshadow visualization transitions, direct attention to
   notable data points, and animate the disclosure of annotations. These
   gestures are integrated into configurable widgets, allowing presenters
   to trigger content transformations by executing gestures within widget
   boundaries, with feedback visible only to them. Altogether, our palette
   of widgets provides a level of flexibility appropriate for
   improvisational presentations and ad-hoc content transformations, such
   as when responding to audience engagement. To evaluate VisConductor, we
   conducted two studies focusing on presenters (N = 11) and audience
   members (N = 11). Our findings indicate that our approach taken with
   VisConductor can facilitate interactive and engaging remote
   presentations with dynamic visual aids. Reflecting on our findings, we
   also offer insights to inform the future of augmented video presentation
   tools.},

Title = {Declutter and Focus: Empirically Evaluating Design Guidelines for

Abstract = {Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see
   as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner
   community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and
   efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines
   suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data
   values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the
   emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines
   for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that
   describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant
   data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written
   annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated
   how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information
   across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six
   graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously
   seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to
   rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and
   trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on
   professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on
   aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the
   highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the
   original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do
   not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based
   tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of
   visualization designers and practitioners. The stimuli, data, analysis
   code, and Supplementary Materials are available at

Title = {Urban Waste Management and Prediction through Socio-Economic Values and
   Visualizing the Spatiotemporal Relationship on an Advanced GIS-Based
   Dashboard},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Enhancing data-driven decision-making is vital for waste authorities.
   Although few studies have explored the influence of socio-economic
   indicators on waste tonnage, comprehensive analysis of urban waste data
   focusing on geographical information is also scarce. There is a dearth
   of dashboards for visualizing waste tonnage with spatial relationship
   maps. This study aims to present a prediction model useful for
   estimating urban waste by using personal income (I), the number of
   income earners (E), land values (L), the estimated resident population
   (P) and population density (D), called the IELPD measures. An innovative
   approach is developed to identify the correlation between urban
   household waste data and socio-economic factors and develop an advanced
   dashboard based on a geographic information system (GIS). To accomplish
   this, relationship maps and regression analysis are deployed to
   visualize household waste data spanning six years of waste production in
   New South Wales, Australia, classified into three categories:
   recyclable, residual and organic (RRO) wastes. Furthermore, this
   classification enables accessing the association between these three
   waste categories and the IELPD metrics. And there are four types of
   visualization generated, that is, thematic mapping, spatial relationship
   maps, correlation matrices and dashboard development. The regression
   analysis shows a substantial association between RRO waste tonnage,
   population changes and a minor correlation with land values. Overall,
   this study contributes to urban waste data storytelling and its
   spatiotemporal associations with socio-economic determinants. This paper
   offers a valuable prediction model of the IELPD metrics to estimate
   urban waste and visualize them in a dashboard allowing practitioners and
   decision-makers to track trends in the RRO waste stream in urban waste

Title = {Computational communication research},
Journal = {WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The article advances a new way to think about computational research, in
   general, and computational communication research, in particular.
   Contrary to current definitions of ``computational science,{''} which
   emphasizes its inductive nature, we define computational research as an
   incomplete inductive process, blending both theoretical and data-driven
   methods of discovery. Communication theory needs to be driven by a clear
   concept of human needs and abilities, recovering and extending known
   theoretical insights from mass and interpersonal communication research.
   The definition we propose for computational communication research has a
   practical implication. Relying on theory, the definition demands to
   identify specific processes and domains within the field of
   computational communication research. The processes include
   communication production, behavior, and effects. The domains include
   collaboration, trust, and data storytelling and journalism, while the
   methods include content and network analyses. The article starts with a
   broad definition of the ``computational{''} approach, using the Johari
   window. We continue with a typology of computational communication
   research, which blends reviews of foundational texts with summaries of
   leading research. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and
   identify new opportunities in the field of computational communication
   research. This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of
   Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction Commercial,
   Legal, and Ethical Issues > Social Considerations Fundamental Concepts

Title = {The effects of generative AI agents and scaffolding on enhancing
   students' comprehension of visual learning analytics},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {234},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Visual learning analytics (VLA) is becoming increasingly adopted in
   educational technologies and learning analytics dashboards to convey
   critical insights to students and educators. Yet many students
   experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their
   limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding
   approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing
   students' comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to
   scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI)
   technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential
   solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance
   students' comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates
   the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with
   scaffolding techniques, in improving students' comprehension of VLA. A
   randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education
   students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive
   agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which
   utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA
   comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield
   comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after
   the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance
   students' VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and
   standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the
   intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with
   scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students' comprehension
   skills and support genuine learning.},

Abstract = {PurposeTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can result in reduced social
   participation due to changes in cognition and communication. This study
   explored Instagram \#TraumaticBrainInjury posts to determine how the
   platform was being used by people with brain injury and how TBI was

   mixed-methods research design. Content analysis was conducted on the top
   100 \#TraumaticBrainInjury posts that met the study criteria. From each
   category identified in content analysis, two-three posts were further
   analysed using visual data analysis, then reflexive thematic analysis
   was used on this data to gain deeper understanding.ResultsContent
   analysis generated four categories: Promotional, Motivational,
   Educational, and Life Experiences. Thematic analysis of nine visual data
   narratives generated four themes: Sharing their Stories, Navigating
   Challenge, Anticipating More, and Building
   Community.ConclusionsCommunity groups and people with TBI facilitated
   social connections and exchange about symptoms, recovery, struggles, and
   day-to-day life. Organisations and health professionals used the
   platform to provide information and promote their services to people
   with TBI. However, health professionals are under-utilised Instagram to
   promote social interactions and advocacy. The overall sentiment of the
   \#TraumaticBrainInjury community was supportive and positive, suggesting
   integration of the platform into TBI rehabilitation would be beneficial
   for targeting social isolation.},

Title = {Developing Novel Tools for Bioethics Education: ACECS and the Visual
   Analytics Dashboard},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 6},
Abstract = {The translation of bedside experience to pedagogical content presents a
   unique challenge for the field of bioethics. The contributions are
   multidisciplinary, the practices are heterogeneous, and the work product
   is characteristically nuanced. While academic bioethics education
   programs have proliferated, developing content and pedagogy sufficient
   to teach clinical ethics effectively remains a longstanding challenge.
   The authors identify three reasons why progress towards this goal has
   been slow. First, there is a lack of robust, empirical knowledge for
   education focused on praxis. Second, the methods employed in academic
   education tend to focus on traditional didactic approaches rather than
   engendering competency through interaction and practice-the principle
   means by which clinical ethicists work. Third, the data practitioners
   have captured has not been presented in a medium educators and students
   can most meaningfully interact with.In this paper, the authors describe
   a novel pedagogical tool: the Armstrong Clinical Ethics Coding System
   (ACECS) and interactive visual analytics dashboard. Together, these
   components comprise an educational platform that utilizes the empirical
   data collected by the institution's ethics service. The tool offers four
   advantages. First, it aids with the identification of ethical issues
   that present during a consultation at that specific institution or
   medical unit by making use of a lingua franca comprehensible to both
   ethicists and non-ethicists. Second, content is centered on issue
   frequency, type, and relation to other issues. Iterating through cases,
   requestors, or hospital units allows one to understand cases
   typologically and through metanarratives that reveal relationships and
   subtle patterns. Third, the use of interactive data visualizations and
   data storytelling aids comprehension and retention. Fourth, the process
   of using the system necessitates understanding the manifold ways each
   case can be understood, accommodating a wide range of perspectives and
   ethical lenses, enhancing case analysis and self-reflection conducive to
   life-long learning.},

Abstract = {This study explored the narratives of low-income school learners' sense
   of belonging in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It provided a historical
   overview of the South African Apartheid system. The study employed the
   narrative inquiry approach of the qualitative research design and is
   hinged on the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used in
   selecting a school, and learners in Grade 8 and 9 consisted of 8 boys
   and 8 girls each. Data (narratives of the learners) were collected
   through Focus Group Discussion and analysed using the three-dimensional
   space inquiry tools - broadening, burrowing, and storying and
   re-storying. Findings revealed the prevalence of poverty, school
   disengagement, and stigmatisation among learners in low-income schools.
   Thus, the effects of poverty on learners lead to their feelings of
   desolation and futility as they experience what is known as a
   low-control-of-effects syndrome. The hope that education may change
   their lives seems to be superseded and dampened by what transpires in
   their poor homes and schools.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that RDM practices are not yet properly
   integrated into daily research workflows, nor supported by any tools
   researchers typically use. To help close this gap, we have elaborated a
   design concept called `Data Story' drawing on ideas from (digital) data
   storytelling and aiming at facilitating the appropriation of RDM
   practices, in particular data curation, sharing and reuse. Our focus was
   on researchers working mainly with qualitative data in their daily
   workflows. Data Story integrates traditional data curation approaches
   with a more narrative, contextual, and collaborative organizational
   layer that can be thought of as a `story'. Our findings come from a
   long-term `embedded' evaluation of the concept and show that: (1)
   engaging with Data Story has many potential benefits, as for example
   peer learning opportunities, better data overview, and organization of
   analytical insights; (2) Data Story can effectively address data
   curation issues such as standardization and unconformity; and (3) it
   addresses a broader set of issues and concerns that are less dealt with
   in the current state of play such as lack of motivation and stylistic
   choices. Our contribution, based on lessons learnt, is to provide a new
   design approach for RDM and for new collaborative research data
   practices, one grounded in narrative structures, capable of negotiating
   between top-down policies and bottom-up practices, and which supports
   `reflective' learning opportunities - with and about data - of many
   kinds.},

Abstract = {Emerging narratives call for recognising and engaging constructively
   with small-scale farmers who have a leading role in shaping the current
   irrigation dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper explores whether
   new irrigation data can usefully inform these narratives. It argues
   that, for a variety of reasons, official irrigation data in sub-Saharan
   Africa fail to capture the full extent and diverse nature of irrigation
   and its rapid distributed growth over the last two decades. The paper
   investigates recent trends in the use of remote sensing methods to
   generate irrigation data; it examines the associated expectation that
   these techniques enable a better understanding of current irrigation
   developments and small-scale farmers' roles. It reports on a pilot study
   that uses radar-based imagery and analysis to provide new insights into
   the extent of rice irrigated agriculture in three regions of Tanzania.
   We further stress that such mapping exercises remain grounded in a
   binary logic that separates `irrigation' from other `non-irrigated'
   landscape features. They can stem from, and reinforce, a conventional
   understanding of irrigation that is still influenced by colonial
   legacies of engineering design and agricultural modernisation. As
   farmers' initiatives question this dominant view of irrigation, and in a
   policy context that is dominated by narratives of water scarcity, this
   means that new data may improve the visibility of water use by
   small-scale irrigators but may also leave them more exposed to
   restrictions favouring more powerful water users. The paper thus calls
   for moving away from a narrow debate on irrigation data and monitoring,
   and towards a holistic discussion of the nature of irrigation
   development in sub-Saharan Africa. This discussion is necessary to
   support a constructive engagement with farmer-led irrigation
   development; it is also challenging in that it involves facing
   entrenched vested interests and requires changes in development
   practices.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore college students'
   perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and their thoughts
   on prevention measures. Design and methods: A qualitative descriptive
   design was used. The study adopted purposive sampling at two
   universities in northern Taiwan and one in central Taiwan. Twenty-six
   college students participated, and data saturation was reached. Content
   analysis was undertaken. Results: Four main themes emerged from the data
   narratives: 1) having very little knowledge of HPV infection, 2) being
   concerned about outcomes of HPV infection, 3) taking measures to protect
   oneself, and 4) expecting to have HPV prevention resources. Conclusions:
   The results indicated that college students needed a more complete
   understanding of HPV and prevention methods to protect themselves from
   infection. Schools were an ideal place to provide adequate information
   on HPV prevention. Practice implications: The study suggested providing
   HPV-related information through school health centers and government
   health departments to resolve common questions and misunderstandings
   about HPV infection. Healthcare professionals should have a complete
   understanding of HPV-related knowledge in order to provide detailed
   information to young people. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {So far, studies on wildlife poaching in Nigeria have focused on its
   health implications, motivations, and rationalizations. The methods of
   operation employed by the poachers to thwart enforcement of
   anti-poaching laws have not been examined. It is in an attempt to bridge
   this gap that this study examined wildlife poaching at the Kainji
   National Park (KNP) Kwara State, from the poachers' perspective and the
   various attendant schemes employed by the poachers to evade arrest and
   prosecution. This study interrogated how enforcement of laws against
   criminalized acts could be frustrated through adoption of schemes to
   evade arrest and prosecution, if a cultural group defines such
   criminalization as an incursion on their cultural heritage. It also
   examined forces propelling wildlife poaching at the Park. The study is
   of the firm believe that knowledge of these schemes would be useful to
   park rangers in adopting a more effective approach to tackle the crime.
   Knowledge of the cultural forces propelling poaching would also be
   useful to the government in initiating appropriate approaches to address
   them. The exploratory research design was employed for the study while
   the qualitative method was used to collect primary data. Narratives were
   generated through in-depth interviews with wildlife poachers at Kaiama
   community. Findings from the study showed that community rationalization
   and justification of hunting as their heritage, and perception of
   establishment of KNP as an incursion on their heritage was a major force
   propelling illegal hunting while the consequent tactics adopted by the
   poachers to evade arrest were: use of mystical powers, decimation of
   vultures, bribery, use of community residents as informants, prediction
   of park rangers' movements, sale of hunted animals to only familiar
   customers and new customers introduced by old customers, and utilization
   of their mastery of the forest environment. Poachers remain persistent
   in the act due to availability of a variety of animals to poach, and
   corruption among the park rangers.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe present conflict in Israel has led to a surge in cases of
   acute stress disorder (ASD). The study examined a training program for
   integrative medicine (IM) providers working in supportive and palliative
   care settings, teaching clinical skills for treating ASD.MethodsA 10-h
   online training program, designed by supportive care trained IM and
   mental health professionals was attended by a group of 32 IM providers.
   The impact of the course was assessed using pre- and post-training
   questionnaires, which underwent qualitative evaluation. Three open-ended
   questions addressed expectations from the program, anticipated barriers
   to combining IM with mental health interventions, and explored
   willingness for multi-disciplinary collaboration. A conventional content
   analysis was used, where coding categories are derived directly from the
   text data. Narratives were analyzed using ATLAS.ti software for
   systematic coding.ResultsNarrative themes identified within the group of
   32 trainees included expectations regarding facilitating a
   multi-disciplinary integrative model of care, enriching the ASD-related
   clinical ``toolbox,{''} increasing the effectiveness of IM treatments,
   and reducing IM treatment-associated risks. Insights were provided for
   bridging communication gaps between IM practitioners and mental health
   providers, supporting the multi-disciplinary
   collaboration.ConclusionsASD-focused training for IM practitioners may
   increase their level of clinical skills and advance collaboration with
   mental health providers. Future research examining the feasibility of
   the integrative model and its implementation in supportive care setting
   is warranted.},

Title = {Cultural identity, leadership and well-being: how indigenous
   storytelling contributed to well-being in a New Zealand provincial rugby
   team},
Journal = {PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {176},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {68-76},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of the article was to explore the application
   and interpretation of indigenous stories introduced in 2015-2017 in
   relation to the identity and leadership (well-being elements) of players
   and coaches of a men's provincial rugby team in Aotearoa/New Zealand
   (NZ).
   Study design: The study utilised a Kaupapa Maori case study approach and
   indigenous forms of storytelling (purakau, whakatauki) to encourage
   participants to share their narratives and experiences of how the
   inclusion of Maori knowledge in a team context influenced their sense of
   identity and leadership and thus well-being on and off the field.
   Methods: Semi-structured, one-on-one, interviews alongside focus group
   discussions generated the data (narratives) collected. Data were
   thematically analysed, utilising aspects of an indigenous model of
   Health Promotion known as Te Pae Mahutonga. Specifically, the cultural
   identity affirmation (Mauri Ora) and leadership (Nga Manukura) elements
   were illustrated as these were applicable to high performance sport
   contexts.
   Results: Analysis revealed that the team narrative, values and
   expectations were enhanced by embracing Maori stories (purakau) and
   symbols. In particular, this enhanced the cultural identity, sense of
   belonging, leadership and well-being of a number of team members on and
   off-field. Neither the players nor coaches disclosed any negative
   impacts to their well-being from incorporating indigenous storytelling
   (purakau, whakatauki) into their team building practices and culture.
   Conclusions: Sport-related research and practices that are informed by
   indigenous knowledge and values can benefit the well-being of indigenous
   people (in this case Maori), collectives (rugby team) and individuals
   (researchers, players and coaches). Further research exploring how
   indigenous knowledge is integrated into sport-related contexts is needed
   to understand whether the well-being of a wider range of teams and
   individuals (women, non-indigenous) may benefit from the inclusion of
   indigenous knowledge, values and practices. (C) 2018 The Royal Society

Abstract = {Climate change is difficult to connect with personally, because people
   only regard the phenomenon as important if it becomes a perceived threat

   show and reinforce actions and thoughts that align with climate action.
   In this design study, we used comics created for human-level climate
   change influence to promote ideas like future-based thinking, sharing of
   responsibility, and caring for each other. We also created data visuals
   that illustrate future consequences of climate change for the purpose of
   averting negative alternative realities. To see whether our design can
   affect audience perception of climate change on the human level of goals
   and desires, we showed the comics to readers unfamiliar with the themes
   of the stories, presenting them as manga about characters and
   situations. The survey showed that data stories can affect the way naive
   readers interpret narratives to align with pro-climate attitudes such as
   sharing and future-vision, and that readers are focused on the
   human-level of the data and story as opposed to the physical resource
   level. Speculative fiction and data visuals provide a potentially
   effective way to influence individuals' climate change attitudes by
   showing alternative realities and attributes of collective
   responsibility and planning-for-the-future as data stories.},

Title = {The Information Communication Technology, Social Media, International
   Migration and Migrants' Relations with Kin in Nigeria},

Abstract = {Studies abound on international migration and remittances across the
   world and studies are particularly not lacking on the subject in Africa.
   There are however few studies on the moderating roles of information
   communication technology (ICT) and social media in the relationships
   among international migration, remittances and relationships in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. This article examines the dimension of ICT and
   social media in migration studies. This is an aspect that has often been
   ignored and overlooked even though ICT and social media have great
   contributions in the international migration process particularly as
   migrants and relatives in sending and receiving countries both have the
   primary experience. Research objectives include: reasons for emigration;
   information technology/social media used by migrants and their kin as
   they relate across spaces; and how ICT affects relationships of kin and
   international migrants. Secondary data were gathered through journals,
   books, documents and reliable Internet sources. Primary data were
   gathered in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2018 through 30 in-depth interviews
   analysed through content analysis. Findings reveal the nature of ICT
   used by international migrants and their kin and purpose of utilization
   and the effects of ICT on international migration, remittances and
   kinship networks. The article presents detailed data, narratives,
   interpretations and implications of relationships among international
   migration, ICT/social media and kinship networks. This article argues
   that ICT/social media is central to international migration
   decision-making, access of migrants and kin to social forces and factors
   motivating international migration, and it is very important to how
   migrants and kin maintain and/or weaken relationships and access to
   remittances and utilization.},

Title = {The development of sarcoidosis in patients receiving daclizumab: A case
   series from multiple clinical trials},
Journal = {RESPIRATORY MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {23-27},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction: Several drugs have been associated with druginduced
   sarcoidosis-like reactions (DISRs) that are clinically indistinguishable
   from sarcoidosis. Daclizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody
   that binds to CD25 that has been studied for the treatment of multiple
   sclerosis (MS). During MS clinical trials of daclizumab, 12 subjects
   developed clinical conditions potentially consistent with sarcoidosis.
   Therefore, an independent adjudication committee of individuals with
   expertise in sarcoidosis was organized to determine the likelihood of
   these cases representing sarcoidosis.
   Methods: The adjudication committee consisted of a pulmonologist,
   pathologist, and radiologist with clinical experience in sarcoidosis.
   The committee had access to the subjects' laboratory data, narratives of
   all suspect adverse reaction reports, radiographic imaging and histology
   from biopsies. A priori, a grading system was developed to determine
   criteria to establish the likelihood that the patient had developed
   sarcoidosis.
   Results: The adjudication confirmed sarcoidosis in 11/12 subjects. The
   committee's decisions were unanimous in all cases. Biopsies were
   available in 7/11 of these. In the 4 subjects who did not have a biopsy,
   they all had presentations, clinical findings, and/or laboratory
   findings that were highly specific for sarcoidosis. Alternative causes
   for these clinical findings were reasonably excluded in all cases. The
   lung (8/11) and skin (6/11) were the most common organs involved. The
   mean daclizumab dose given when signs or symptoms of sarcoidosis
   occurred was 5413 +/- 2704 mg and the median time from first daclizumab
   dose was 996 days. The incidence rate of developing sarcoidosis in those
   participating in these daclizumab trials was 154/100,000 patient-years
   compared with incidence rates of sarcoidosis in the United States of
   3.2-17.8/100,000/year. These data suggest that these sarcoidosis cases
   may have represented DISRs related to daclizumab therapy.
   Conclusions: Given the clinical presentation and subsequent evaluation
   of these 11 subjects, we suspect that they had DISRs from daclizumab.},

Title = {The lived experiences of brokered brides who have attempted suicide in
   Taiwan},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {18},
Number = {24},
Pages = {3409-3420},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Aims and objectives.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the lived experiences of
   brokered brides who have attempted suicide in Taiwan.
   Background.
   There has been a significant rise in number of brokered brides since the
   1970s in Western world and since the 1990s in several Asian countries.
   However, there is a great lack of research on brokered brides' suicide
   around the world.
   Design.
   A descriptive phenomenological study was used to explore the lived
   experiences of brokered brides who have attempted suicide.
   Methods.
   Purposive sampling, one-on-one, in-depth with semi-structural interviews
   were conducted to collect data. Narratives were analysed by Colaizzi's
   (1978) seven-step method.
   Results.
   Data saturation was achieved after interviewing 12 brokered brides. The
   study group was comprised of females whose average age was 33. Three
   themes and the sub-themes were: being a chrysalis (loss of support,
   loneliness, suffering abused experience, loss of self-esteem), death of
   a chrysalis (loss of hope and seeking salvation) and birth of a
   chrysalis (regaining hope and sense of self-worth).
   Conclusions.
   These brokered brides suffered from numerous pressures and difficulties
   in life. Their hopelessness led to suicidal behaviours as a way to get
   out of trouble. Hence, the need to provide brokered brides with
   substantial assistance and support in their lives is an issue that
   cannot be neglected. The results of this study could be used as a
   reference to provide professionals and the public with a deeper
   understanding of suicide in this vulnerable group, and provide more
   appropriate help and care.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   The suffering may be alleviated by giving brokered brides a reliable
   support system that they so obviously need. Several recommendations have
   been made, including amendments in terms of policy, society and the
   services offered by healthcare professionals.},
