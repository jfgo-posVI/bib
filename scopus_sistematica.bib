	abstract = {While there are several “writing buddy” Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) apps that check grammar and language usage, not many focus exclusively on enhancing the brainstorming process for writing across disciplines. To fill this gap, a team of staff and student assistants with programming and User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) expertise designed and prototyped a web app named “Waai,” which rhymes with ‘why,’ that could assist students throughout the writing process for a first-year general writing module for all undergraduate students at a Singaporean university. Utilising surveys, focus group discussions, and app data that shows the nature and type of student engagement with the Waai app, this paper studies the impact of one aspect of the Waai app, an uni-directional chatbot named “Nudgy,” as a first step to optimising interactions with an AI chatbot for writing purposes. Overall, we found that students were able to benefit from the GenAI chatbot Nudgy in 5 distinct ways: 1) its pre-engineered prompts, which were tailored to the course assignment rubrics; 2) its tendency to recommend topics to research rather than give students answers; 3) its suggested research topics, which helped students to consider different perspectives on their topics; 4) how it modelled ways to ideate new insights; and 5) its constant availability. Students, however, expressed reservations about the Nudgy, particularly in terms of: 1) the limitations of pre-engineered prompts within the app; 2) difficulty in discerning the most relevant of the Nudgy feedback; 3) mistrust in GenAI and Aigiarism; and 4) a recognition of the limitations of GenAI in supporting argumentative writing. “Waai” essentially presents a decision-making framework for brainstorming based on cognitive socialisation, a method of learning that emphasises inductive as opposed to deductive experience that could be applied to online environments, as an ideology of learning that considers, among other aspects, the development of selfhood, where learning is both guided and mediated (Kesebir & Gardner, 2010). In the context of asynchronous learning, meaning is not intrinsic but rather picked up through interactions on online platforms. Interacting with a chatbot with pre-designed prompts result in a ritual that both define and explore the limits of knowledge building. Symbolic interactionism (Aksan et al., 2009) through the medium of technology is a key objective of 21st century education, where ‘learning’ is internalised as an individual experience. Waai offers educatros additional understanding of the effects of personalization (Mygland et al., 2021) as proposed by this design-based study of the role of instruction in the creation of online ‘learning’ experiences. The centrality of instruction and standards of reasoning through the process of brainstorming suggests that the developmental stages of ‘learning’ concepts could empower a process for self-regulation (Zimmerman, 1989) that goes beyond immediate causes and effects to inspire a spiral of reflection and change essential to ideation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In a journalism and communication landscape where data plays an increasingly important role in crafting reliable and engaging stories, data storytelling has become an integral part of the industry. Traditionally, journalism has often followed a linear, author-driven, and explanatory approach to storytelling. However, the rise of data storytelling has prompted a significant shift towards more interactive and reader-driven stories, with a higher potential for exploration. While the literature in the field has studied aspects such as interactivity in data visualisations, linearity and storytelling structures, the discourse surrounding exploratory features of data stories is relatively recent and scarce, and it remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and studies the exploratory and explanatory characteristics of data stories, and their interdependencies. It further examines the relationships of these facets with other key attributes of data stories, specifically linearity, interactivity, and storytelling structures. This is done through analysing a broad selection of data stories (N = 118) sourced from a variety of news outlets. Results uncover the complementary roles exploratory and explanatory characteristics play in data stories, and reveal the nuances in relationships with the other three facets. The findings provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of data story design and practical insights for data journalists seeking to balance explanation and exploration in their narratives. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Businesses, planners and policy makers must make decisions that influence a future about which they have incomplete knowledge. Whilst knowing the future may be illusive, the capacity to adapt as required, is desirable for both organisations and society. We examine what different perspectives can offer, considering how empirical-analytical (e.g., modelling, data), narrative-experiential (e.g., fiction, history, gaming), and socio-technological (e.g., AI, social media) approaches contribute to anticipating futures. From this overview we detect a fundamental role of narrative as a framing device, and we examine various aspects of its inescapable value no matter what the perspective. We assert that whilst narratives are important to the success of planning activities and to their subsequent uptake and utility, they are no guarantee of success, serving only to animate the body of experience. We identify that a good narrative starts an evidence-based process which is dynamic and evolves as others engage with it; little is achieved without engagement. Narratives can shift focus or intention, or become hijacked, and the evolving narrative becomes an emergent property of a complex system with no one person or group controlling the process. We argue that an understanding of the essential role of narrative is critical in considering futures, and in achieving desirable outcomes. To this end we identify narratives as complex dynamic systems that involve multiple actors and feedback loops. A better understanding of the drivers of such dynamics is needed as a precursor to developing techniques to limit the potential for narrative distortion or derailing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Despite their growing prevalence, little is known about their components and how they are designed. Thus, two studies were conducted. Study 1 analyzed 40 mDVs and revealed their narrative components. Study 2 examined, through design sessions with design experts, how such components are assembled to craft storyboards for mDVs. The diverse narrative styles of mDVs render them flexible and suitable for multiple topics and purposes. Further, many include a “Linker” directing viewers to external online resources. Participants approached their design in a structural yet iterative manner with emphasis on setting up a “hook” in the opening seconds to capture attention.

	abstract = {Narrative visualization facilitates data presentation and communicates insights, while virtual reality can further enhance immersive and engaging experiences. The combination of these two research interests shows the potential to revolutionize the way data is presented and understood. Within the realm of narrative visualization, empirical evidence has particularly highlighted the importance of camera planning. However, existing works primarily rely on user-intensive manipulation of the camera, with little effort put into automating the process. To fill the gap, this paper proposes CineFolio, a semi-automated camera planning method to reduce manual effort and enhance user experience in immersive narrative visualization. CineFolio combines cinematic theories with graphics criteria, considering both information delivery and aesthetic enjoyment to ensure a comfortable and engaging experience. Specifically, we parametrize the considerations into optimizable camera properties and solve it as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) to realize common camera types for narrative visualization, namely overview camera for absorbing the scale, focus camera for detailed views, moving camera for animated transitions, and user-controlled camera allowing users to provide inputs to camera planning. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with cases of various data and chart types. To further evaluate our approach, we conducted a within-subject user study, comparing our automated method with manual camera control, and the results confirm both effectiveness of the guided navigation and expressiveness of the cinematic design for narrative visualization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Visual learning analytics (VLA) is becoming increasingly adopted in educational technologies and learning analytics dashboards to convey critical insights to students and educators. Yet many students experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing students’ comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance students’ comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with scaffolding techniques, in improving students’ comprehension of VLA. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance students’ VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students’ comprehension skills and support genuine learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To distill a data story into a video, designers need to draft a sequence of data facts and visually connect them by animated transitions. Such animated transitions are critical for illustrating data changes and enhancing narrative coherence; however, their design still lacks systematic guidance. To fill this gap, we developed a design space by collecting and analyzing 89 high-quality data videos. The design space characterizes the design of animated transitions under three dimensions: narrative relation, data change, and transition animation. We conducted an online design workshop with 14 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of our design space on designing transitions. The results show that the design patterns summarized in our design space can be used to efficiently guide the transition designs in data videos. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this study, we analyze city governments’ public presentations of their data-centered projects as a form of data storytelling and reveal how the documents adopt contrasting data presentation techniques to construct and activate two unique ideals of data-driven governance: urban service management and social reform. When reiterating the familiar narrative of data-drivenness as real-time monitoring and optimization of services, documents demonstrate accomplishments in numbers and keep most of the cities’ data work hidden from the public. In contrast, the emerging narratives of social reform suggest city governments as leaders committed to tackling structural injustices through data-driven approaches and invite the public to interrogate their data work through interactive, open-ended data visualizations. However, we argue that the increased visibility of government data and delegation of power to citizens signaled by the social reform narratives do not succeed in challenging the dominant epistemology or power hierarchy in data-driven regimes. Instead, the signaled values are leveraged to justify an ideal of entrepreneurial citizens in the documents which is still exclusionary. This finding suggests that scholars and civic societies take more nuanced approaches to demands for government transparency and accountability, as well as calls for more attention to the political effects of these mundane forms of data communication between governments and their constituents. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study examines how storytelling and play-based activities-effective methods for foreign language instruction in early childhood-can be employed in English teaching through theoretical foundations and practical data. Storytelling, with its capacity to engage children’s imagination and internalize linguistic patterns, and play, which offers social interaction, repetition, and reinforcement, together create a holistic language acquisition process. Supported by qualitative research methods, this investigation demonstrates that storytelling and play-based instruction have a positive impact on learners’ vocabulary, grammatical structures, and, in particular, their oral proficiency. Additionally, these methods significantly enhance learners’ motivation. The findings suggest that language teaching should move beyond traditional methods by adopting creative and interactive techniques that are suited to children’s developmental characteristics. In this context, storytelling and play-based English instruction emerge not only as a vehicle for academic success but also as a practical approach for fostering longlasting and meaningful language acquisition. In addition, recent developments in digital learning environments, mobile applications, and artificial intelligence-based tools have significantly transformed the landscape of language education. These innovations not only facilitate personalized and autonomous learning but also enhance learners’ motivation and engagement. Consequently, integrating technology into language education has become increasingly indispensable, especially in addressing the diverse needs of modern learners across formal and informal contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Narrative visualization integrates data visualization and narrative techniques to convey a compelling story. Narrative visualization is notoriously difficult to evaluate. One solution is heuristic evaluation, using a domain-specific set of heuristics. This paper validates a set of heuristics proposed specifically for evaluating narrative visualization. We conducted studies with experienced narrative visualization practitioners in both summative and formative settings. We found that the set of heuristics showed promise in a summative setting, where similar responses evidenced that the set of heuristics could provide reliable evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in a formative setting, implementing the set of heuristics was reported to be useful in the design process; however, due to their limited focus, we recommend that it be implemented in conjunction with other evaluation guidelines. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Narrative mapping, an advanced geographic information visualization technology, presents spatial information episodically, enhancing readers’ spatial understanding and event cognition. However, during 3D scene construction, viewpoint selection is heavily reliant on the cartographer’s subjective interpretation of the event. Even with fixed-angle settings, the task of ensuring that selected viewpoints align with the narrative theme remains challenging. To address this, an automated viewpoint selection method constrained by narrative relevance and visual information is proposed. Narrative relevance is determined by calculating spatial distances between each element and the thematic element within the scene. Visual information is quantified by assessing the visual salience of elements as the ratio of their projected area on the view window to their total area. Pearson’s correlation coefficient is used to evaluate the relationship between visual salience and narrative relevance, serving as a constraint to construct a viewpoint fitness function that integrates the visual salience of the convex polyhedron enclosing the scene. The chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) algorithm is utilized to locate the viewpoint position while maximizing the fitness function, identifying a viewpoint meeting narrative and visual salience requirements. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the maximum projected area method and fixed-value method, a higher viewpoint fitness is achieved by this approach. The narrative views generated by this method were positively recognized by approximately two-thirds of invited professionals. This process aligns effectively with narrative visualization needs, enhances 3D narrative map creation efficiency, and offers a robust strategy for viewpoint selection in 3D scene-based narrative mapping. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the process of creating these stories remains challenging, often requiring the integration of effective visualizations with compelling narratives to form a cohesive, interactive presentation. To help streamline this process, we present an integrated authoring framework and system, DataWeaver, that supports both visualization-to-text and text-to-visualization composition. DataWeaver enables users to create data narratives anchored to data facts derived from “call-out” interactions, i.e., user-initiated highlights of visualization elements that prompt relevant narrative content. In addition to this “vis-to-text” composition, DataWeaver also supports a “text-initiated” approach, generating relevant interactive visualizations from existing narratives. Key findings from an evaluation with 13 participants highlighted the utility and usability of DataWeaver and the effectiveness of its integrated authoring framework. The evaluation also revealed opportunities to enhance the framework by refining filtering mechanisms and visualization recommendations and better support authoring creativity by introducing advanced customization options. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Knowledge graphs assist users to better understand domain knowledge by reorganizing and aggregating information. In the application scenario, recent research has mainly focused on constructing knowledge graphs to create narrative visualizations from the perspective of humanities expert, but the mapping relationship between knowledge graphs and narrative scripts which visualization designers specialize in remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to explore the use of cultural heritage knowledge graphs for producing narrative scripts that creatively preserve and communicate cultural heritage. To achieve this, the researchers constructed an ethnic costumes knowledge graph based on data collected from the Chinese National Museums of Ethnology and a literature survey. We conducted an experiment to identify typical patterns in data exploration and narrative scripts that linked to the designers’ authorial intent and process. Based on our analysis, we present design recommendations for narrative visualization with knowledge graphs that could provide practical guidance in designing cultural heritage information visualization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Communicating insights from data effectively requires design skills, technical knowledge, and experience. Data must be accurately represented with aesthetically pleasing visuals and engaging text to effectively communicate to the intended audience. Data storytelling has received much attention lately, but as of yet, it does not have a theoretical and practical foundation in information science. A data story adds context, narrative, and structure to the visual representation of data, providing audiences with character, plot, and a holistic experience of narrative. This paper proposes a methodological approach to transform a data visualization into a data story based on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the S-DIKW Framework. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid, the proposed approach defines a strategy to represent insights extracted from data. Data is then turned into information by identifying character(s) facing a problem, adding textual and graphic content; information is turned into knowledge by organizing what happens as a plot. Finally, a call to wise action—always informed by cultural and community values—completes the storytelling transformation to create a data story. This article contributes to the theoretical understanding of data stories as emerging information forms, supporting richer understandings of a story as information in the information sciences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the impact of a visual perception learning model based on inclusive design principles on improving data storytelling skills in digital visualization—an important competency in the changing landscape of information technology (IT). As data-driven decision-making becomes more prevalent across industries, effective data storytelling is critical for communicating complex insights. This study contributes to IT by introducing a systematic learning framework and interactive digital tools that assist learners in creating accessible and impactful visual narratives. The framework has five major stages: exploration, conceptualization, application, evaluation and iteration, and reflection. These stages help learners understand the relationship between visual perception and inclusive design, promoting the creation of high-quality data visualizations. Expert evaluations gave the model a high overall rating of 4.86 out of 5 stars. Participants demonstrated significant improvement in their understanding of visual perception and inclusive design, with a strong correlation between the two concepts (r=0.784). The digital learning tools, which were designed to be accessible and engaging, received positive usability feedback (M=4.73, S.D.=0.41) and effectively motivated learners. Assessment results also showed that participants improved their data storytelling skills (M=4.41, S.D.=0.64), demonstrating proficiency in both tool usage and visualization design. While the study emphasizes strengths, it also identifies challenges in simplifying complex data, creating compelling narratives, and mastering advanced visualization tools. These findings highlight the importance of inclusive design in IT education, providing learners with the necessary digital skills to create professional, engaging, and accessible visualizations. This study emphasizes the importance of continued advancements in IT-driven learning models for improving storytelling techniques and digital data visualization skills. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study begins by reviewing the role of gender data in women’s empowerment within China’s socio-political context, followed by an outline of the feminist data narrative concepts that combine Couldry’s theory of data as narrative with insights from data feminism. Using these two cases, it illustrates how and why these collectives engage in data feminism to foreground gender justice.

	abstract = {Introduction: Although numerous studies have investigated collisions involving public buses, there has been inadequate research on passenger injuries caused by non-collision incidents on public buses. One major obstacle is that the manual extraction of thematic information from massive document repositories is exceedingly labor intensive, cumbersome, and inaccurate. Our study thereby illustrated how to automatically characterize non-collision injury incidents on public buses by fusing advanced language processing techniques and large-scale incident reports. Methods: Based on the 12,823 textural narratives recorded by police during 2010–2019 in Hong Kong, the structural topic modeling was developed to uncover underlying themes, quantify topic prevalence, and portray complex interconnectedness. Results: Thirty-three topics were successfully labeled, with the topic stand and lost balance being the most prevalent. Non-collisions were more likely to result in serious consequences when incidents occurred because the bus skidded, when a passenger was boarding, and when a standing passenger lost the balance. Six unique patterns were uncovered, i.e., the failure to hold handrails accompanied by inappropriate behaviors of bus drivers when approaching bus stations, loss of balance among standing passengers due to the sharp braking of bus drivers in response to red traffic lights ahead, alighting passengers being hit by the door, passengers falling while climbing staircases, passengers being injured because of bus driver's emergency maneuvers to avoid collisions with nearside pedestrians, and passengers being injured due to the careless lane-changing of bus drivers when weaving through roundabouts. Conclusions: By leveraging the emerging text mining techniques, unstructured narratives written by the police can provide valuable and organized information for regular injury surveillance. Tailor-made countermeasures were proposed to prevent non-collision injury incidents on public buses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In medical narratives, characters are crucial for engaging audiences, making complex medical information accessible, and potentially influencing positive behavioral and lifestyle changes. However, designing characters that are both educational and relatable to effectively engage audiences is challenging. We propose a GenAI-assisted pipeline for character design in data-driven medical stories, utilizing Stable Diffusion, a deep learning text-to-image model, to transform data into visual character representations. This approach reduces the time and artistic skills required to create characters that reflect the underlying data. As a proof-of-concept, we generated and evaluated two characters in a crowd-sourced case study, assessing their authenticity to the underlying data and consistency over time. In a qualitative evaluation with four experts with knowledge in design and health communication, the characters were discussed regarding their quality and refinement opportunities. The characters effectively conveyed various aspects of the data, such as emotions, age, and body weight. However, generating multiple consistent images of the same character proved to be a significant challenge. This underscores a key issue in using generative AI for character creation: the limited control designers have over the output. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

One of the ways to increase engagement and understanding of this data is through narrative visualizations, as they utilize elements that can enhance understanding of the presented data in different ways. In this context, after a literature review on elements of narrative data visualizations, we identified a gap in detailed descriptions of narrative genres. Considering this, we conducted a focus group with professionals in the field, which resulted in the concept called “Navis Structure.” It organizes narrative genres into components for design assistance. In this case, the genres can be single-component or multi-component. Additionally, these genres were classified, considering not only this structure but also visual representation, interaction techniques, freedom of exploration, and narrative approach. Finally, we conducted a workshop with professionals experienced in data visualization to analyze and validate the proposed concept, believing that the findings contribute to advancing the understanding of narrative genres and guide future research in narrative data visualizations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students’ learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers interpret students’ data through these dashboards, many have overlooked the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual representations of students’ data. In this paper, we address this gap by investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We illustrate this by analyzing teachers’ think-aloud sessions as they engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs. Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also, visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be detrimental. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objectives Cough occurring in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was first described in 1935 and is a frequently discussed symptom on patient forums. We aimed to systematically review the available evidence to explore the prevalence and risk factors for persistent cough in patients diagnosed with RCC to establish whether cough could be a presenting symptom of RCC. Design This epidemiological systematic review used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 2020. Data sources Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO trials register were searched without language restrictions until 1 June 2023. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We included articles of all study designs reporting cough in patients (18 years or older) with RCC attributed to the disease itself or to treatment. Data extraction and synthesis Data from included articles was extracted using a preprepared and piloted form, and quality assessment was conducted independently by two authors. The risk of bias was assessed in studies other than case reports or case series using the critical appraisal instrument for studies reporting prevalence data. Narrative techniques were used for data analysis and, where appropriate, meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed. Results Of 509 studies screened, 105 full-text articles were assessed, with 46 papers subsequently excluded, resulting in 59 analysed in depth. There were 105 patients with RCC reported as having a cough due to the disease itself within 30 case reports and 8 case series. When present, most coughs were described as persistent and dry in nature. The cause of cough was attributed to various aetiologies including pulmonary and endobronchial metastasis and paraneoplastic syndromes. Studies reporting patients with RCC developing a cough because of systemic treatment were heterogeneous. Two studies with 238 patients on temsirolimus and 230 on interferon-α (IFN-α) were suitable for meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model. Patients on temsirolimus were more likely to develop a cough than those on IFN-α (OR 1.95 with a 95% CI of 1.05 to 3.63, overall effect Z=2.12 (p=0.03), I 2 =0%). Conclusion Cough can occur in patients with RCC, as part of the disease pathogenesis, as an adverse effect of systemic treatment or due to unrelated causes such as pre-existing conditions (eg, asthma). Further research is required to determine the true prevalence and cause and to assess whether cough could be a presenting symptom for RCC. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction Cerebral palsy (CP) is a paediatric disorder with permanent impairment of movement and posture with a prevalence of about 2.11 in 1000 births in the world. Given the therapeutic effect of hand-arm bimanual intensive therapy including lower extremities (HABIT-ILE) in children with CP, a systematic review of the available literature on this topic is warranted. The objective of this study is to systematically review the effectiveness of HABIT-ILE on upper extremity, lower extremity and trunk outcomes within the domains of body functions and structures, activity and participation of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health in children with CP. Methods and analysis This study will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Searches will be conducted in six databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, OT seeker and Web of Science for available published literature. The grey literature sources will include WorldCat, National Technical Information Service, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Open Grey, WHO and OpenDOAR. Manual searches of citations of included papers will be performed to collect all experimental studies of HABIT-ILE in children with CP. The level of evidence for included articles will be classified according to the level of evidence in the guidelines for systematic reviews on the American Occupational Therapy Association website. Based on the study design of the included articles, the risk of bias will be assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, the Cochrane Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions tool and the quality assessment tool recommended by the American Occupational Therapy Association. In order to synthesise the data, narrative synthesis will be used, along with meta-analysis, if available. Ethics and dissemination As this study only reviewed previously published articles, ethical approval was not required. The findings will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic negatively affected nursing home administrators (NHAs). This study explores licensed and employed NHA’s perceptions about what work stress events would drive their turnover intentions (TI) in year 3 of the pandemic. Research Design and Methods: As part of a larger survey-based research project collecting numerical and textual data, this study conducted content analysis with qualitative data. Narrative data from 3,859 discrete responses of 1,139 NHAs, from 50 states and Washington, DC, on 2 open-ended electronic survey questions asking about their work stress and TI were collected from February to March 2022. Categories and subcategories were counted and discussed in context as themes. Results: We identified 4 main narrative categories with subcategories about NHA’s stress about the regulatory system (e.g., excessive, conflicting, changing regulations), staffing (e.g., insufficient, agency staff), organizational pressures (e.g., work overload), and macro system stressors (e.g., media representation of nursing homes). Three main TI categories with subcategories were identified: the long-term care (LTC) setting and system (e.g., regulatory demands, staffing, facility surveys); personal factors (e.g., stress, career opportunities); and others (e.g., “I would never quit” or “I already decided to quit”). Discussion and Implications: Whole community disaster planning, person-centered surveyor training, improved regulatory guidance, simplified reporting, adequate guidance assistance, and adequate staff could mitigate NHA stress and TI during crises. Administrator resilience should be recognized. Solutions for supporting NHAs can include long-term care industry participation in public health disaster preparedness coalitions, consistent regulatory guidelines with established communication channels, and ongoing crisis leadership training for administrators. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This research examines the definitions of Data Science and Data Scientist, as well as the Data Science careers in different nations. The data with 169 rows are extracted from LinkedIn and JobStreet which are based in Malaysia from February 2023 to April 2023 by using web crawling and web scraping techniques in Python. Next are the key competencies in a Data Scientist's toolkit which are hard and soft skills that would be analysed through data visualization. For data processing and analysis, proficiency in programming languages such as R, Python, and SQL is required. In addition, proficiency with visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI allows for effective results. Furthermore, communication and visualization skills are essential for effective data storytelling. Data scientists must be excellent communicators to explain complex findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It is easier to effectively share findings when visualizations that are aesthetically pleasing and data-driven are produced.

However, the literature so far shows these goals are not being reached, as ‘common’ (non-expert) citizens fail to access and understand OGD. This research makes an empirical contribution to this debate through a design experiment in the form of a field lab with a governmental agency, data visualization experts, and non-expert citizens in the Netherlands. In this field lab, the current practice of disseminating OGD by a regional water authority on the issue of drought was redesigned based on non-expert citizens’ needs. Our findings show that non-expert citizens prefer data storytelling techniques over OGD portals or traditional OGD visualizations such as graphs or dashboards. This is informative for the current shift from OGD geared at expert users, to OGD geared at fostering effective transparency with non-expert users. We also build on existing research to develop new evaluation criteria for OGD visualizations, and find that completeness and usability seem more important than objectivity in disseminating OGD with non-expert citizens when communicating about complex policy problems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data videos increasingly becoming a popular data storytelling form represented by visual and audio integration. In recent years, more and more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants were invited to design data videos with and without our design space guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our design space provides useful and practical guidance for data storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, manually creating such comics is currently time-consuming, complex, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose DG COMICS, a novel comic authoring tool for dynamic graphs that allows users to semi-automatically build and annotate comics. The tool uses a newly developed hierarchical clustering algorithm to segment consecutive snapshots of dynamic graphs while preserving their chronological order. It also presents rich information on both individuals and communities extracted from dynamic graphs in multiple views, where users can explore dynamic graphs and choose what to tell in comics.

We currently witness an increase in web-based, data-driven initiatives that call themselves “atlases” while explaining complex, contemporary issues through data and visualizations: climate change, sustainability, AI, or cultural discoveries. To understand this emerging genre and inform their design, study, and authoring support, we conducted a systematic analysis of 33 visualization atlases and semi-structured interviews with eight visualization atlas creators. Based on our results, we contribute (1) a definition of a visualization atlas as a compendium of (web) pages aimed at explaining and supporting exploration of data about a dedicated topic through data, visualizations and narration. (2) a set of design patterns of 8 design dimensions, (3) insights into the atlas creation from interviews and (4) the definition of 5 visualization atlas genres. We found that visualization atlases are unique in the way they combine i) exploratory visualization, ii) narrative elements from data-driven storytelling and iii) structured navigation mechanisms.

	abstract = {Narrative visualization transforms data into engaging stories, making complex information accessible to a broad audience. Foundation models, with their advanced capabilities such as natural language processing, content generation, and multimodal integration, hold substantial potential for enriching narrative visualization. Recently, a collection of techniques have been introduced for crafting narrative visualizations based on foundation models from different aspects. We build our survey upon 66 articles to study how foundation models can progressively engage in this process and then propose a reference model categorizing the reviewed literature into four essential phases: Analysis, Narration, Visualization, and Interaction. Furthermore, we identify eight specific tasks (e.g., Insight Extraction and Authoring) where foundation models are applied across these stages to facilitate the creation of visual narratives. Detailed descriptions, related literature, and reflections are presented for each task. To make it a more impactful and informative experience for diverse readers, we discuss key research problems and provide the strengths and weaknesses in each task to guide people in identifying and seizing opportunities while navigating challenges in this field. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study was grounded in the materiality, performativity, and reflexivity framework of data journalism and the civic engagement model. The findings were that the main themes of data-driven narratives on X were politics, socioeconomic discourse, and particularly economic metrics. Materiality and performativity showed up in the human agency of journalists and in the skills and expertise of those who contextualise and interpret the data. Data journalists liaise with allied data production specialists to convert raw data into data artifacts to tell stories. Ghanaian X users actively used the offered data stories to participate in civic arguments and discussions on social media. They back data stories with personal anecdotes. Through the proactive deployment of surveys, the creation of X polls, and other cooperative efforts, the examined narratives illustrated the performativity of data journalism as a technique that subverts power structures. The study provides evidence for the important role of peripheral actors in data journalism and how their efforts drive civic discourse to potentially drive tangible societal transformations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They leverage visualization and storytelling to convey information to broader audiences. Likewise, immersive technologies, like augmented and virtual reality devices, provide excellent potential for exploring and explaining data, thus inviting research on how data-driven storytelling transfers to immersive environments. To gain a better understanding of this exciting novel research area, we conducted a scoping review on the emerging notion of immersive data-driven storytelling, extended by surveying immersive data journalism and by analyzing immersive games, selected based on community reviews and tags. We present our methodology for the survey and discuss prominent themes that coalesce the knowledge we extracted from the literature, journalism, and games. These themes include, among others, the spatial embodiment of narration, the incorporation of the users and their context into narratives, and the balance between guiding the user versus promoting serendipity. Our discussion of these themes reveals research opportunities and challenges that will inform the design of immersive data-driven stories in the future. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As universities grapple with contentious socio-political climates, promoting intergroup relations efforts remains critical in mitigating these conflicts. Intergroup dialogue (IGD) provides one approach to improving intergroup relations in higher education. Prior evidence suggests that IGD reduces prejudice, increases empathy, builds critical consciousness, and improves intergroup relations. However, scant studies document virtual and multi-site IGD, especially those that include varied stakeholders. The current study sought to close these gaps by offering a facilitated and sustained four-stage model of IGD that concluded with collaborative action projects. A total of 32 students, faculty, and staff from eight universities in California participated in a virtual 20-hour, two-semester IGD program aimed to (1) generate dialogue around systemic barriers to graduation and (2) create action projects that address equity issues. Pre- and post-surveys with 22 participants showed increased intergroup empathy, improved comfort in having difficult conversations, and increased interest in future action behaviors. The participants also developed 10 action projects aimed at closing equity gaps through data storytelling, resource dissemination, dialogue programming, and policy advocacy. Our study adds to the effectiveness of IGD in higher education, offers important lessons learned, and highlights the implications of this work for both IGD practitioners and universities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data-rich documents are commonly found across various fields such as business, finance, and science. However, a general limitation of these documents for reading is their reliance on text to convey data and facts. Visual representation of text aids in providing a satisfactory reading experience in comprehension and engagement. However, existing work emphasizes presenting the insights within phrases or sentences, rather than fully conveying data stories within the whole paragraphs and engaging readers. To provide readers with satisfactory data stories, this paper presents Narrative Player, a novel method that automatically revives data narratives with consistent and contextualized visuals. Specifically, it accepts a paragraph and corresponding data table as input and leverages LLMs to characterize the clauses and extract contextualized data facts. Subsequently, the facts are transformed into a coherent visualization sequence with a carefully designed optimization-based approach. Animations are also assigned between adjacent visualizations to enable seamless transitions. Finally, the visualization sequence, transition animations, and audio narration generated by text-to-speech technologies are rendered into a data video. The evaluation results showed that the automatic-generated data videos were well-received by participants and experts for enhancing reading. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study examined a training program for integrative medicine (IM) providers working in supportive and palliative care settings, teaching clinical skills for treating ASD. Methods: A 10-h online training program, designed by supportive care trained IM and mental health professionals was attended by a group of 32 IM providers. The impact of the course was assessed using pre- and post-training questionnaires, which underwent qualitative evaluation. Three open-ended questions addressed expectations from the program, anticipated barriers to combining IM with mental health interventions, and explored willingness for multi-disciplinary collaboration. A conventional content analysis was used, where coding categories are derived directly from the text data. Narratives were analyzed using ATLAS.ti software for systematic coding. Results: Narrative themes identified within the group of 32 trainees included expectations regarding facilitating a multi-disciplinary integrative model of care, enriching the ASD-related clinical “toolbox,” increasing the effectiveness of IM treatments, and reducing IM treatment-associated risks. Insights were provided for bridging communication gaps between IM practitioners and mental health providers, supporting the multi-disciplinary collaboration. Conclusions: ASD-focused training for IM practitioners may increase their level of clinical skills and advance collaboration with mental health providers. Future research examining the feasibility of the integrative model and its implementation in supportive care setting is warranted. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To address the challenge, we first summarize the commonly used graphical overlays and narrative structures, and the proper correspondence between them in financial narrative visualizations, elected by a survey of 1752 layered charts with corresponding narratives. We then design FinFlier, a two-stage innovative system leveraging a knowledge-grounding large language model to automate graphical overlays for financial visualizations. The text-data binding module enhances the connection between financial vocabulary and tabular data through advanced prompt engineering, and the graphics overlaying module generates effective overlays with narrative sequencing. We demonstrate the feasibility and expressiveness of FinFlier through a gallery of graphical overlays covering diverse financial narrative visualizations. Performance evaluations and user studies further confirm system's effectiveness and the quality of generated layered charts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The study employed the narrative inquiry approach of the qualitative research design and is hinged on the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used in selecting a school, and learners in Grade 8 and 9 consisted of 8 boys and 8 girls each. Data (narratives of the learners) were collected through Focus Group Discussion and analysed using the three-dimensional space inquiry tools–broadening, burrowing, and storying and re-storying. Findings revealed the prevalence of poverty, school disengagement, and stigmatisation among learners in low-income schools. Thus, the effects of poverty on learners lead to their feelings of desolation and futility as they experience what is known as a low-control-of-effects syndrome. The hope that education may change their lives seems to be superseded and dampened by what transpires in their poor homes and schools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The narrative visualization was intended to allow easy interpretation of information on: (i) student rates of completion of courses that are critical to becoming eligible for college admission; (ii) student mathematics course trajectories; and (iii) mathematics course placement decisions. Using the notion of graphical excellence, I identify specific visualization strategies and features that improve the quality of the narrative visualization and support practitioners use of them. Drawing on liberatory design thinking, I discuss how this form of reporting findings builds trust and facilitates engagement between partners, increases practitioners' agency, and thus creates more equitable power dynamics in RPPs and for the multilingual students at the core of the one discussed here. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sentiment and emotion analyses (SEA) provide us with the opportunity to gain objective and fast insights into the experiences of vast amounts of individuals. Despite SEA’s efficiency, two main limitations associated with its use remain: outcome aggregation and narrow applicability. Outcome aggregation means that outputs do not consider participants’ attributes nor allow for individual analyses of participants’ experiences and/or the degree to which these experiences may express consistent or contradictory emotions (i.e., emotional entropy). Narrow applicability means that SEA has primarily been employed in market research to understand customers’ satisfaction thus foregoing its applicability in qualitative and mixed methods academic research. With these opportunities and limitations in mind, our study was designed to offer an analytic framework that avoids outcome aggregation and expands the use of SEA beyond market research. As part of our study’s contribution, we offer a free to use and free to distribute software tool that implements the totality of our proposed analytic framework. This software does not require any programming proficiency and executes all required back-end processes locally—thus avoiding the need to upload our data to any servers. In our proposed framework, outcome aggregation is avoided via network modeling that also enables testing for potential differences in emotions distributions across groups. Based on this integration, we refer to the resulting analytic framework and software as Sentiment and Emotion Network Analysis—SENA. As part of our methodological and research design discussion, we also illustrate how to integrate SENA with machine learning text classification of documents or open-ended responses. This integration serves to leverage the power of artificial intelligence in studies relying on SENA. The databases used to showcase this analytic framework are provided so that researchers may interact firsthand with the SENA framework and its externally peer-reviewed software (https://cutt.ly/BrhEnyfY) available in Mac (https://cutt.ly/QwhYruBr) and Windows (https://cutt.ly/YwhJJKvO) operating systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To address this gap, our work leverages emotional theory to derive patterns for crafting emotionally resonant climaxes of data videos. We first analyzed the climaxes of 96 data videos, categorizing them into eight emotional dimensions based on Plutchik's basic emotion model. Based on data analysis, we then formulated 40 patterns for creating narrative climaxes. To evaluate the patterns when applied as design hints, we conducted a user study with 48 participants, where Group A created data video climaxes using our patterns, Group B created them without our patterns, and Group C used other patterns as the baseline. Evaluations by two experts and 20 general audiences revealed that the climaxes created with the patterns were more emotionally engaging. The participants also praised the clarity and practicality of the patterns. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the context of data storytelling for data workers. Data storytelling communicates insights and knowledge from data analysis. It plays a vital role in data workers’ daily jobs since it boosts team collaboration and public communication. However, to make an appealing data story, data workers need to spend tremendous effort on various tasks, including outlining and styling the story. Recently, a growing research trend has been exploring how to assist data storytelling with advanced artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing studies focus more on individual tasks in the workflow of data storytelling and do not reveal a complete picture of humans’ preference for collaborating with AI. To address this gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 data workers to explore their preferences for AI collaboration in the planning, implementation, and communication stages of their workflow. We propose a framework for expected AI collaborators’ roles, categorize people's expectations for the level of automation for different tasks, and delve into the reasons behind them. Our research provides insights and suggestions for the design of future AI-powered data storytelling tools. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Our life stories evolve in specific and contextualized places. Although our households may be our primarily shaping environment, our neighborhoods expose us to the immediate “real world” outside home. Indeed, the places where we are currently experiencing and have experienced life play fundamental roles in the development of our identities, beliefs, fears, perceptions of the world, and even in the (mis)understanding of our prospects of social mobility. Despite the analytic benefits that knowledge of the places and contexts where we experience life brings to better understanding our life stories and health outcomes, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods researchers continue to forego the analytic and elucidating power that geo-contextualizing our participants' narratives bring to our analyses, research findings, conclusions, and plans of action. From this view then, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods research findings and conclusions may have been ignoring the spatial contexts that most likely have shaped the experiences of research participants. The main reason for the underuse of these geo-contextualized stories is the requirement of specialized training in geographical information systems (GIS) and/or computer and statistical programming along with the absence of cost-free and user-friendly geo-visualization tools that may allow non-GIS experts to benefit from geo-contextualized outputs. To address this gap, we present GeoStoryTelling, an analytic framework and user-friendly, cost-free, multi-platform software that enables researchers to visualize their geo-contextualized qualitative narratives. The use of this peer-reviewed software (see https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.7385885.v3), available in Mac (https://cutt.ly/E724wAx) and Windows (https://cutt.ly/J724f0C) operating systems, does not require users to learn GIS nor computer/statistical programming to obtain state-of-the-art, and visually appealing and interactive maps. These resulting HTML visualizations are capable of integrating a variety of multi-media inputs that include text, image, videos, sound recordings/music, as well as hyperlinks to other websites—see https://cutt.ly/k7X9tfN. Since GeoStoryTelling relies on OpenStreetMap, its applications may be used worldwide, thus strengthening its potential reach to the qualitative, mixed methods, ethnographic, and health scientific communities, regardless of location around the world. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper examines how a human-centred LA dashboard can be further refined and adapted by teachers while actively using it in a real-world scenario (i.e., design-in-use), beyond its intended design (i.e., design-for-use). We use instrumental genesis as a theoretical lens to analyze the temporary and permanent instrumentalization of design features and individual and collective instrumentation of the LA dashboard. The analysis of semi-structured individual interviews with five nursing teachers who used an LA dashboard to guide team reflections with 224 students (56 teams) revealed technical and pedagogical changes that occurred in both the system’s features (instrumentalization) and teaching practices (instrumentation). We found that teachers adopted the LA dashboard beyond initially intended ways by (i) providing emotional support with the analytics, (ii) reducing details in AI-powered data visualizations for easier comprehension, (iii) creating data narratives to address data limitations, and (iv) collectively developing new practices to use the LA dashboard for co-teaching. Therefore, teachers’ design-in-use of the LA dashboard highlights the ongoing need for design improvements to address challenges posed by dynamic data and complex algorithms underlying AI and analytics interfaces. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background  Health informatics education is pivotal in integrating diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) principles into curricula and leveraging data with equity considerations. Integrating clinically driven data with other datasets is crucial to comprehensive understanding of patient care demographics, experiences, and outcomes to create equity-minded data storytelling. Publicly available Healthy People 2030 (HP2030) resources complement academic electronic health records, supporting tailored learning activities in informatics education to enhance educational utility through a DEIA lens. Objectives  This case report describes the expansion of an existing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) checklist to an updated DEIA checklist for preparing future informaticians to collect and critically evaluate DEIA features using this checklist in creating equity-minded data storytelling. Methods  The DEI-Oriented Data Storytelling Model and the HP2030 framework were utilized to develop the DEIA checklist. We employed an informal cognitive walkthrough to expand the DEIA checklist and evaluate the DEIA measures or characteristics within datasets from the HP2030 social determinants of health (SDOH) five topics using this checklist. Results  We reviewed 76 available SDOH-related datasets and added six measures to demographics and seven to skills, abilities, and accessibility of the DEIA checklist. Our evaluation of the DEIA checklist verified HP2030's inclusion of all measures, except religions/beliefs. All DEIA measures were linked to equity and accessibility, one in inclusion, and the inclusion of three characteristics comprising the category language and six characteristics comprising the category images. Conclusion  Results highlighted the accessibility and comprehensiveness of HP2030 demographic data resources, considering SDOH factors and promoting inclusive data representation to address health disparities. The DEIA checklist provides a structured tool in facilitating unbiased data collection and visualization of SDOH-related data through an equity-informed lens. Integrating an equity-minded data storytelling with frameworks like HP2030 enriches health informatics education, broadens students' understanding of health disparities, and supports evidence-based interventions for improved health outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1INH) is a rare condition, clinically characterised by recurrent swelling. The unpredictability of attacks affects the patients’ quality of life (QoL). HAE patients and their families have vast unmet physical, psychological, and social needs. A human-centred design (HCD) approach to describing the needs of different user types is to utilise personas, a data-driven narrative tool for communicating user archetypes that capture the individuals’ attitudes, goals, and behaviours. The aim of this study was to create and analyse personas based on HAE patients’ and their caregivers’ interviews. Semi-structured interviews were conducted through anthropological conversations with patients, patient-caregivers (double role of patient and caregiver), and non-affected caregivers. Qualitative and quantitative insights from analyses formed the basis to create personas. Results: We enrolled 17 subjects: 15 patients (6 of them were patient-caregivers) and 2 non-affected caregivers. The mean age of participants was 50.3 ± 14.4 years. Eight patients were on treatment with prophylactic therapy. The mean percentage score of Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL) for HAE patients was 19.8 ± 12.0. Six personas were identified describing the participants’ personal history, disease management, and needs: four personas referred to patients, one to patient-caregivers, and one non-affected caregiver personas were identified. Across patient personas, the most expressed needs were psychological support and better awareness amongst healthcare professionals. Caregivers, on their side, desired better information about the disease, including the latest therapies, and higher awareness within the community. Conclusion: A Human Centred Innovative Approach Based on Persona extends beyond the physical symptoms to encompass the psychological and social aspects of the individual's well-being also including the family in the evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As data journalism continues to rise, narrative visualization has emerged as an essential method for conveying information. To improve the user experience of narrative visualization projects for data journalism, this study introduces an innovative approach for narrative visualization design centered on user experience. Firstly, through an in-depth analysis of existing research, we constructed a comprehensive user-experience-based narrative visualization model, considering the designers’ design process and the multiple levels of the user experience process. Then, through case analysis and user interviews, we identified the key elements that influence the user experience. Through the analysis of multiple cases, this study presents a practical narrative visualization design methodology comprising eight dimensions, aimed at enhancing user experience. The primary contribution of this research lies in the proposal of a practical narrative visualization model and the clear definition of key design elements, providing a comprehensive reference framework for designers and researchers to effectively optimize the user experience of narrative visualization. Moreover, our research findings unveil the inherent correlation between user experience and design elements, offering valuable insights for future research and practical applications.

	abstract = {Effective narrative visualization communicates information by integrating story-telling and data visualization in a comprehensible, compelling manner. The compelling aspect of effective narrative visualization consequentially results in the potential to shift the attitude of an audience. However, there is much to understand about how narrative visualization can best be designed to influence target audiences. This paper focuses on an empirical experiment where we examined the effects of two communication strategies - anthropomorphism and personal identification - on a young adult audience. In particular, we wanted to understand which strategy, when integrated into narrative visualization, can nudge a specific audience’s attitude towards greater consideration in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicated that the personal identification communication strategy was the most successful in nudging participants. This study contributes a better grasp of how technologies such as narrative visualization, using different communication strategies, can deliver more targeted messaging. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This poses the challenge of communicating key information about health conditions and their management in a way that is easily understood by a general audience. In this paper, we propose the use of data-driven storytelling to address this challenge, in particular through interactive data comics. We developed an interactive data comic that communicates cancer data. A between-group study with 98 participants was carried out to evaluate the data comic's ease of understanding and engagement, compared to a text medium that captures the same information. The study reveals that the data comic is perceived to be more engaging, and participants have greater recall and understanding of the data within the story, compared with the text medium. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Augmented video presentation tools provide a natural way for presenters to interact with their content, resulting in engaging experiences for remote audiences, such as when a presenter uses hand gestures to manipulate and direct attention to visual aids overlaid on their webcam feed. However, authoring and customizing these presentations can be challenging, particularly when presenting dynamic data visualization (i.e., animated charts). To this end, we introduce VisConductor, an authoring and presentation tool that equips presenters with the ability to configure gestures that control affect-varying visualization animation, foreshadow visualization transitions, direct attention to notable data points, and animate the disclosure of annotations. These gestures are integrated into configurable widgets, allowing presenters to trigger content transformations by executing gestures within widget boundaries, with feedback visible only to them. Altogether, our palette of widgets provides a level of flexibility appropriate for improvisational presentations and ad-hoc content transformations, such as when responding to audience engagement. To evaluate VisConductor, we conducted two studies focusing on presenters (=11) and audience members (=11). Our findings indicate that our approach taken with VisConductor can facilitate interactive and engaging remote presentations with dynamic visual aids. Reflecting on our findings, we also offer insights to inform the future of augmented video presentation tools. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Here, we present GRETA Analytics, an R Shiny application developed to communicate the output of the GRETA (GReen Energy Transition Actions) EU Horizon 2020 research project. The tool presents and visualizes data collected from qualitative case studies, an extensive multinational survey in 16 EU countries, their re-use in scenario predictions, and their framing for developing interactive transition pathways for individuals and communities. With a strong geospatial focus and a narrative design, the tool promotes collaborative sense-making processes of the real world instead of plain visualization. This paper addresses the development process, design choices, data integration strategies, architecture details, and deployment methods of the tool. We demonstrate how using collaborative and interactive dashboards can enhance the communication of research projects and support a geographical understanding of energy citizenship and energy transition actions, which were the overall goals of the GRETA project. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We argue that this is now true of interfaces in GIScience that deliver narrative visualizations, including 3D virtual narrative environments. These spaces allow for controlled conditions and realistic natural settings, where spatio-temporal data can be collected and used to ascertain how well an interface design fulfilled a given narrative function. This study investigates the function of a cognitively inspired geospatial interface (Future Vision) that aimed to determine how mental images can be situated in geospatial environments and used to convey narratives that improve user cognition and decision-making. The results of a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) decision-making task showed that participants using future thinking guidance (mental images as a split-second display of correct path choice) had statistically significant improvements in their task completion times, movement speeds and 2AFC decision-making, compared to the unguided control group. Implications of the results include benefits for cue-based navigation of real and conceptual spaces in GIScience. Future research can improve the interface design by modifying the interface code to reduce visual loss caused by eye blinks and saccades. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While scholars recognize its significance, the audience-centric aspects remain underexplored. This study focuses on Eco-Nai+, a digital geo-journalism platform aiming to be Nigeria’s first. It provides interactive data access via web and mobile apps and tools for geospatial data handling. Employing a multi-method approach, including document analysis, interviews, and platform analysis, this study examines how geo-data enhances data-driven storytelling, fosters cooperation and co-creation in data collection, and creates a new income stream for news organizations. From a business standpoint, Eco-Nai + functions as a “newstech” company, capitalizing on digital age challenges. It offers journalists a means to inform and engage the public and policymakers in vital environmental discussions, especially in environments with limited open data sources. Crowdsourcing data is critical in this context, where open data and freedom of information legislation are lacking. This research contributes to the data journalism discourse by exploring audience involvement in data-driven storytelling and advocating for public participation in data journalism projects to enhance reporting and understand data’s societal role. It also underscores the value of geojournalism skills in delivering spatial products and thematic maps, adding context and insights beyond numerical data. Eco-Nai + exemplifies the potential for data journalism to bridge information gaps and drive meaningful conversations in an increasingly data-centric world. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Knowledge communication in cultural heritage and digital humanities currently faces two challenges, which this paper addresses: On the one hand, data-driven storytelling in these fields has mainly focused on human protagonists, while other essential entities (such as artworks and artifacts, institutions, or places) have been neglected. On the other hand, storytelling tools rarely support the larger chains of data practices, which are required to generate and shape the data and visualizations needed for such stories. This paper introduces the InTaVia platform, which has been developed to bridge these gaps. It supports the practices of data retrieval, creation, curation, analysis, and communication with coherent visualization support for multiple types of entities. We illustrate the added value of this open platform for storytelling with four case studies, focusing on (a) the life of Albrecht Dürer (person biography), (b) the Saliera salt cellar by Benvenuto Cellini (object biography), (c) the artist community of Lake Tuusula (group biography), and (d) the history of the Hofburg building complex in Vienna (place biography). Numerous suggestions for future research arise from this undertaking. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Extracting data insights and generating visual data stories from tabular data are critical parts of data analysis. However, most existing studies primarily focus on tabular data stored as flat tables, typically without leveraging the relations between cells in the headers of hierarchical tables. When properly used, rich table headers can enable the extraction of many additional data stories. To assist analysts in visual data storytelling, an approach is needed to organize these data insights efficiently. In this work, we propose CoInsight, a system to facilitate visual storytelling for hierarchical tables by connecting insights. CoInsight extracts data insights from hierarchical tables and builds insight relations according to the structure of table headers. It further visualizes related data insights using a nested graph with edge bundling. We evaluate the CoInsight system through a usage scenario and a user experiment. The results demonstrate the utility and usability of CoInsight for converting data insights in hierarchical tables into visual data stories. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Little is known about how these evaluation challenges are addressed by narrative visualization practitioners. We surveyed experienced narrative visualization practitioners to investigate their methods of evaluation. To gain deeper insight we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with practitioners. We found that there is usually an informal approach to narrative visualization evaluation, where practitioners rely on prior experience and their peers for evaluation. Our study also revealed novel approaches to evaluation. We introduce a practice-led heuristic framework to aid practitioners to evaluate narrative visualization systematically. Our practice-led heuristic framework couples first-hand practitioner experience with recent research literature.

	abstract = {Vision provides rapid processing for some tasks, but encounters strong constraints from others. Although many tasks encounter a capacity limit of processing four visual objects at once, some evidence suggests far lower limits for processing relationships among objects. What is our capacity limit for relational processing? If it is indeed limited, then people may miss important relationships between data values in a graph. To test this question, we asked people to explore graphs of trivially simple 2 × 2 data sets and found that half of the viewers missed surprising and improbable relationships (e.g., a child’s height decreasing over time). These relationships were spotted easily in a control condition, which implicitly directed viewers to prioritize inspecting the key relationships. Thus, a severe limit on relational processing, combined with a cascade of other capacity-limited operations (e.g., linking values to semantic content), makes understanding a graph more like slowly reading a paragraph then immediately recognizing an image. These results also highlight the practical importance of “data storytelling” techniques, where communicators design graphs that help their audience prioritize the most important relationships in data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Data storytelling courses position students as agents in creating stories interpreted from data about a social problem or social justice issue. The purpose of this study is to explore two research questions: What themes characterized students’ iterative development of data story topics? Looking back at six years of iterative feedback, what categories of data literacy pedagogy did instructors engage for these themes?. Design/methodology/approach: This project examines six years of data storytelling final projects using thematic analysis and three years of instructor feedback. Ten themes in final projects align with patterns in feedback. Reflections on pedagogical approaches to students’ topic development suggest extending data literacy pedagogy categories – formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020). Findings: Data storytelling can develop students’ abilities to move from being consumers to creators of data and interpretations. The specific topic of personal data exposure or risk has presented some challenges for data literacy instruction (Bowler et al., 2017). What “personal” means in terms of data should be defined more broadly. Extending the data literacy pedagogy categories of formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020) could more effectively center social justice in data literacy instruction. Practical implications: Implications for practice include positioning students as producers of data interpretation, such as role-playing data analysis or decision-making scenarios. Social implications: Data storytelling has the potential to address current challenges in data literacy pedagogy and in teaching critical data literacy. Originality/value: Course descriptions provide a template for future data literacy pedagogy involving data storytelling, and findings suggest implications for expanding definitions and applications of personal and folk data literacies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Design and methods: A qualitative descriptive design was used. The study adopted purposive sampling at two universities in northern Taiwan and one in central Taiwan. Twenty-six college students participated, and data saturation was reached. Content analysis was undertaken. Results: Four main themes emerged from the data narratives: 1) having very little knowledge of HPV infection, 2) being concerned about outcomes of HPV infection, 3) taking measures to protect oneself, and 4) expecting to have HPV prevention resources. Conclusions: The results indicated that college students needed a more complete understanding of HPV and prevention methods to protect themselves from infection. Schools were an ideal place to provide adequate information on HPV prevention. Practice implications: The study suggested providing HPV-related information through school health centers and government health departments to resolve common questions and misunderstandings about HPV infection.

However, little is understood about how network-monitoring dashboard designs impact user experience in an augmented virtuality (AV) environment. Our study proposes that a dashboard design showing variations in selected elements can impact the network-monitoring flow experience of users by affecting their enjoyment, concentration, and control, which in turn can influence their performance in critical, complex, and time-sensitive environments. To investigate this phenomenon, we design and evaluate two narrative visualization user interfaces—a designer-driven (DD) design and a user-driven (UD) design—in the context of network-monitoring dashboards. Adding vivid and familiar real-world objects may enhance perceived realism; thus, we integrate AV with the two dashboard designs (i.e., DD and UD) and evaluate their effect on user flow experience and performance. Results suggest that the flow experience of users will lead to positive perceived performance. A nonlinear relationship between AV and dashboard design, and the UD design with a moderate AV level can improve user flow experience and performance compared with the DD design. When the AV level is nonexistent or excessive, the superior effect of the UD design disappears. Lastly, we discuss practical implications and theoretical contributions, along with future research directions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Inspired by the daily use of e-mail, V-Mail seeks to enable a similar style of rapid, multi-person communication accessible on any device; however, it aims to do this in the new context of spatial 3D communication, where limited access to 3D graphics hardware typically prevents such communication. The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration, spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail 'data stories' are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client, implemented as a plugin. Results and evaluation from applying V-Mail to assist communication within an interdisciplinary science team studying Antarctic ice sheets confirm the utility of the asynchronous, cross-platform collaborative framework while also highlighting some current limitations and opportunities for future work. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

To address this issue, this research project applies the concept of conceptual story model to the design of narrative map products and uses the hand-rolled map as a carrier to design an interactive narrative system. It utilizes a three-level model based on emotional design theory to design narrative videos and employs narrative theory to organize the storyline of the Nanjing Ming City Wall (NMCW). The experimental and statistical results show that the proposed method effectively represents the historical and cultural characteristics of the NMCW, aiding participants' understanding and supporting public dissemination of historical knowledge. It contributes to the multidimensional representation of historical scenes, enhancing public awareness and encouraging participation in cultural heritage conservation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The application of big data visualization in teaching is becoming more and more common. The study introduces this method into tourism education and combines it with “educational data narrative” to jointly construct a visual learning analysis framework based on “educational data narrative”. To determine the purpose of the study and the research object, we set up a controlled teaching experiment for tourism education in colleges and universities and conducted a pre-and post-test to verify the academic levels of the experimental group and the control group. The classroom behaviors of the experimental group before and after the experiment were further observed and counted to investigate the effectiveness of the teaching method in improving teaching interactivity from the perspective of classroom emotional atmosphere, teacher’s influence in the classroom, student interaction, and classroom structure as a whole. Before the experiment, the performance of the experimental group and the control group in the six courses of tourism management majors was similar, with no significant differences. The experiment resulted in significant P-values at the 1% level for both groups on the 6 courses, and the experimental group had a significantly higher academic level than the control group. In terms of emotional climate in the classroom, the experimental group fell in the positive integration grid ratio, which was improved, and the defective grid ratio decreased after the experiment. Teachers had an indirect influence ratio of 32.75% and a direct influence ratio of 8.73%, respectively. The ratio of students’ verbal behavior was 29.26%. The teacher’s speech ratio, student’s speech ratio, silence ratio, and technology ratio were 41.48%, 29.26%, 7.86%, and 21.40%, respectively. Traveling classroom interactivity has obviously improved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

No longer in the hands of specialists, data is more readily available to use than ever before. However, despite increasing access to data tools, capabilities within marketing teams have not kept up with the pace of change. Investment in data tools will not lead to better data-enabled decision making unless supported by the right marketing capabilities. Critical thinking skills are often overlooked in data storytelling best practice, with more emphasis on visualisation and creative communications. However, it is the critical thinking skills that enable marketers to extract the value from data to ensure the stories both stand up to scrutiny and stand out from the noise. This paper focuses on the needs to build capabilities in three core areas:identifying the ‘so what?’ insights from the data, distilling insights into a few salient points of view and clarifying the ‘now what?’ recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Rapid urban growth stands out as a paramount contributor to the prevailing global sustainability challenges, threatening the environmental, social, and economic qualities of human life. It entails intertwined processes where competing interests determine the use of space, and the allocated space for nature is often crowded out by business and development needs. While urban development processes can adhere to sustainability principles, solely prioritizing the alignment of the urban environment's form and function with human desires and needs overlooks the realities of climate disruption and biodiversity loss. This points to the urgency of reorienting urban design and landscaping practices toward ways the built environment embraces and participates in nature and accounts for species other than humans in placemaking processes. This article responds to this challenge by exploring the use of data storytelling for digital placemaking. We present a design framework for creating data stories with a more-thanhuman (MTH) perspective that could provide entry points for integrating socio-ecological systems thinking in urban placemaking. The proposed framework serves not only as a method but also as a tool to facilitate this broader perspective. In essence, the envisaged outcome of employing MTH data stories goes beyond mere narratives; rather, their aim is to instigate collaborative discussions, negotiations, awareness, sense-making, and reflexivity in placemaking processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The study assessed the satisfaction level of stakeholders with Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Solid Waste Management (SWM) in Ghana. The study was underpinned by the pragmatist paradigm and mixed-methods design. Purposive and stratified random sampling techniques were used to engage 777 respondents for the data. Narrative inquiry, descriptive statistics and ANOVA were used to analyse the data. The study found that even though there was low participation of service users in the contractual arrangement regarding PPP in SWM, the service agreement was highly responsive to their (73%) SWM needs, as they (51.6%) were generally satisfied with the service provided through the agreement. This finding was at variance with the general participation-satisfaction nexus that greater participation leads to stakeholder satisfaction and vice-versa. The implication is that a high level of responsiveness of a service to the needs of stakeholders could sometimes offset the need for greater participation to enhance satisfaction. The result further suggests that the responsiveness-satisfaction nexus is stronger than the participation-satisfaction nexus in the PPP arrangement for SWM in Ghana. The study recommends that PPP arrangements in SWM in Ghana should focus more on adopting innovative ways to deliver services under the agreement to continuously address the immediate needs of service users and sustain their relevance in public service management. It also recommends that Assembly persons should utilise town hall meetings to increase the participation of service users in the contractual and implementation issues regarding PPP in SWM. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) dashboards are becoming increasingly available in various learning settings. However, teachers may face challenges in understanding and interpreting the data visualisations presented on those dashboards. In response to this, some LA researchers are incorporating visual cueing techniques, like data storytelling (DS), into LA dashboard design to reduce the data visualisation skills - often referred to as visualisation literacy (VL) - and cognitive effort required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. However, despite the potential of DS principles in simplifying data visualisations, there is limited evidence supporting their effectiveness in actually reducing teachers’ cognitive load. The study presented in this paper addresses this gap by investigating the potential impact of LA dashboards, with and without DS elements, on teachers with varying VL levels. Through a quasi-experimental study involving 23 teachers, we analysed changes in pupil dilation - a proxy for cognitive load - as they examined LA dashboards featuring student data captured while participating in synchronous, online collaborative learning tasks. Our findings suggest DS can reduce cognitive load, particularly for teachers with lower VL. These results provide insight into the effects of DS and VL on teachers’ cognitive load, thereby informing the design of LA dashboards. Implications for practice or policy: • Developers of LA dashboards need to pay more attention to incorporating visual and narrative elements that are easily comprehensible and target-oriented, based on users’ visualisation literacy levels. • Educational providers and LA designers can recommend dashboards with DS elements to teachers with low VL to enhance their work efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Existing automated data storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a Kanaka ʻŌiwi (Native Hawaiian) Critical Race Theory (KanakaʻŌiwiCrit) framework to conceptualize the relationship between identity and interracial and intraracial relations among multiracial Kanaka ʻŌiwi youth. KanakaʻŌiwiCrit is defined then applied to review research on minority racial identity models and Indigenous identity constructs. To address the gap in literature on the racialization of Kanaka ʻŌiwi youth, a three-dimensional model that explicates how contemporary racial identities form under the social, cultural, and political conditions of multiracial societies afflicted by racism is proposed. Using composite, data-driven narratives, the model conceptualizes four major Kanaka ʻŌiwi racial identity profiles: a state of hōʻole (denial), a state of hoʻokaʻawale (disconnect), a state of huikau (confusion), and a state of mana (power). The significance of geographic contexts in racial identity formation for multiracial Kanaka ʻŌiwi youth living in Hawai‘i versus the global diaspora is also explored before concluding with future paths. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Graph or network data are widely studied in both data mining and visualization communities to review the relationship among different entities and groups. The data facts derived from graph visual analysis are important to help understand the social structures of complex data, especially for data journalism. However, it is challenging for data journalists to discover graph data facts and manually organize correlated facts around a meaningful topic due to the complexity of graph data and the difficulty to interpret graph narratives. Therefore, we present an automatic graph facts generation system, Calliope-Net, which consists of a fact discovery module, a fact organization module, and a visualization module. It creates annotated node-link diagrams with facts automatically discovered and organized from network data. A novel layout algorithm is designed to present meaningful and visually appealing annotated graphs. We evaluate the proposed system with two case studies and an in-lab user study. The results show that Calliope-Net can benefit users in discovering and understanding graph data facts with visually pleasing annotated visualizations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When telling a data story, an author has an intention they seek to convey to an audience. This intention can be of many forms such as to persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories, numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable, memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of 'character-oriented design'. We identify the roles and visual representations data characters assume as well as the types of relationships these roles have with one another. We identify characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify their visual representations. We then illustrate 'character-oriented design' by showing how to develop data characters with common data story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data storytelling process using character-oriented design.

The art of nursing, while not clearly defined reflects behaviors and actions that embody the values of nursing. The aged care setting is underutilized as a clinical learning environment but can potentially teach novice nurses the importance of human relationships and connectedness that underpin the art of nursing. This paper reports on the qualitative phase of a broader study. Semistructured interviews were used to collect narrative data. Narrative analysis was undertaken to construct meaning from stories shared by participants. The COREQ checklist was used as the reporting framework for the study. The aged care setting was found to be a valuable learning environment for novice nurses. Two primary narratives are presented: aged care as a learning environment, which describes barriers and supportive learning factors within the aged care setting; and learning the complexities of nursing care, which illustrates the significance of caring interactions and the practice of holistic care. The value of aged care work experience is in developing humanistic skills such as the importance of social interaction. These are paramount to providing care and building therapeutic relationships. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Results showed that the proposed framework enables it to handle unit data sets. As an example, we presented data storytelling from the water particle monitoring (relative humidity) from one Atacama Desert station, known to be one of the driest areas on Earth, across hidden patterns such as inundation and microweather. Finally, the developed framework makes possible any research on the univariate unit data decision-making, enabling the database import and adjusting some parametric models, and enabling the comparison of different units’ distribution goodness-of-fit. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

From early infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism, harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts, emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism. We then summarize six roles of computing in journalism and their implications. Based on these implications, we provide propositions for visualization research concerning each role. Ultimately, by mapping the roles and propositions onto a proposed ecological model and contextualizing existing visualization research, we surface seven general topics and a series of research agendas that can guide future visualization research at this intersection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, little research exists on the design rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping, simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study results indicate that different chart components play different roles in attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails. Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles. Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This essay argues that emerging forms of translational work in the field of medical humanities offer valuable methods for engaging with communities outside of academic settings. The first section of the essay provides a synthetic overview of definitions and critical engagements with the concept of 'translation' in the context of medical humanities, a field that, in the wake of the COVID pandemic, can serve as an exemplar for other fields of the humanities. The second section explains the 'data/narrative' divide in medicine and health to demonstrate the need for new translational methodologies that can address this nexus of concern, particularly in collaboration with constituencies outside of academic settings. The third section maps out the sites and infrastructures where digital medical humanities is poised to make significant translational interventions. The final section of the essay considers data privacy and health ecology as conceptual frameworks that are necessary for bridging the data/narrative divide. Examples are drawn from the 'Translational Humanities for Public Health' website, which aggregates projects worldwide to demonstrate these emerging methodologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that RDM practices are not yet properly integrated into daily research workflows, nor supported by any tools researchers typically use. To help close this gap, we have elaborated a design concept called ‘Data Story’ drawing on ideas from (digital) data storytelling and aiming at facilitating the appropriation of RDM practices, in particular data curation, sharing and reuse. Our focus was on researchers working mainly with qualitative data in their daily workflows. Data Story integrates traditional data curation approaches with a more narrative, contextual, and collaborative organizational layer that can be thought of as a ‘story’. Our findings come from a long-term ‘embedded’ evaluation of the concept and show that: (1) engaging with Data Story has many potential benefits, as for example peer learning opportunities, better data overview, and organization of analytical insights; (2) Data Story can effectively address data curation issues such as standardization and unconformity; and (3) it addresses a broader set of issues and concerns that are less dealt with in the current state of play such as lack of motivation and stylistic choices. Our contribution, based on lessons learnt, is to provide a new design approach for RDM and for new collaborative research data practices, one grounded in narrative structures, capable of negotiating between top-down policies and bottom-up practices, and which supports ‘reflective’ learning opportunities – with and about data – of many kinds. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although physical artifacts that represent data have been used for centuries, the research field—known as data physicalization—has only recently gained traction. Compared to data visualization, there is no established vocabulary for analyzing and discussing the properties of physicalizations. Through a grounded analysis of examples and literature, we propose a comprehensive design vocabulary, which consist of three separate, but connected parts: explicit variables, implicit properties, and consequential aspects. Explicit variables build on visual variables known from visualization and extend it to account for physicalization’s multi-modal nature. Implicit properties concern elements which are central to the design intention and user experience of physicalizations, yet are not a result of “explicit” encoding strategies. Finally, consequential aspects refer to unintentional effects of design decisions, that influence how a physicalization is experienced. Our work illustrates how physicalizations incorporate opportunities and challenges that are not afforded in other data representations, such as embodiment and imagined touch. With this, we contribute to generating theory on physicalization. Our design vocabulary can support (1) creators through informing their design processes and highlighting design strategies, (2) educators, and (3) academics and practitioners to analyse existing physicalizations, and reflect on the impact of design decisions on interpretation and experience. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While WWE has expanded into communities across the USA, it is relatively unknown in other countries across the globe. This study, in collaboration with community and patient partners, aimed to examine the relevance, acceptability and feasibility of introducing WWE into a UK context. After initial cultural adaptation, participants were recruited into the study. Eligible (≥18 years, doctor diagnosed arthritis (confirmed or self-report), self-reported joint symptoms in last 30 days, BMI ≥25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and <150 min/week of moderate/vigorous PA) and consented participants were randomized into two groups: WWE programme or usual care. A mixed-methods analysis approach integrated quantitative data (physical performance assessment; baseline and post-six week programme questionnaire) and qualitative data (narrative interviews exploring participants’ pre- and post-WWE experiences and stakeholders’ perceptions). Of 149 participants, the majority were women (70%) aged ≥60 years (76%). Among the 97 receiving the programme, 52 chose instructor-led; 45 chose self-directed. Participants found WWE relevant and acceptable—99% indicating they would recommend WWE to family/friends. Within both WWE formats, mixed differences representing improvement were observed at 6 weeks from baseline for physical performance and arthritis symptoms. Emergent themes included improved motivation, health, and social well-being. WWE is a relevant and acceptable walking programme with scope for wider implementation to support UK health and well-being policy strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the emergence of data science as an inherently multidisciplinary subject, there is increasing demand for graduates with well-rounded competence in computing, analytics, and communication skills. However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students’ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Large-scale issues with a spatial and temporal context such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war against Ukraine, and climate change have given visual storytelling with data a lot of attention in online journalism, confirming its high effectiveness and relevance for conveying stories. Thus, new ways have emerged that expand the space of visual storytelling techniques. However, interactive visual data stories with a spatio-temporal context have not been extensively studied yet. Particularly quantitative information about the used layout and media, the visual storytelling techniques, and the visual encoding of space-time is relevant to get a deeper understanding of how such stories are commonly built to convey complex information in a comprehensible way. Covering these three aspects, we propose a design space derived by merging and adjusting existing approaches, which we used to categorize 130 collected web-based visual data stories with a spatio-temporal context from between 2018 and 2022. An analyzis of the collected data reveals the power of large-scale issues to shape the landscape of storytelling techniques and a trend towards a simplified consumability of stories. Taken together, our findings can serve story authors as inspiration regarding which storytelling techniques to include in their own spatio-temporal data stories. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Enhancing data-driven decision-making is vital for waste authorities. Although few studies have explored the influence of socio-economic indicators on waste tonnage, comprehensive analysis of urban waste data focusing on geographical information is also scarce. There is a dearth of dashboards for visualizing waste tonnage with spatial relationship maps. This study aims to present a prediction model useful for estimating urban waste by using personal income (I), the number of income earners (E), land values (L), the estimated resident population (P) and population density (D), called the IELPD measures. An innovative approach is developed to identify the correlation between urban household waste data and socio-economic factors and develop an advanced dashboard based on a geographic information system (GIS). To accomplish this, relationship maps and regression analysis are deployed to visualize household waste data spanning six years of waste production in New South Wales, Australia, classified into three categories: recyclable, residual and organic (RRO) wastes. Furthermore, this classification enables accessing the association between these three waste categories and the IELPD metrics. And there are four types of visualization generated, that is, thematic mapping, spatial relationship maps, correlation matrices and dashboard development. The regression analysis shows a substantial association between RRO waste tonnage, population changes and a minor correlation with land values. Overall, this study contributes to urban waste data storytelling and its spatiotemporal associations with socio-economic determinants. This paper offers a valuable prediction model of the IELPD metrics to estimate urban waste and visualize them in a dashboard allowing practitioners and decision-makers to track trends in the RRO waste stream in urban waste generally. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Accidents in the process industry involve several interacting factors, including human and organizational factors (HOFs). A long-standing obstacle to HOFs analysis is lack of data. Accident reports are an essential data source to learn from the past and contain HOFs-related data, but they are usually unstructured text in a not standardized format. Some studies have explored the extraction of information automatically from accident reports based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. However, they were not dedicated to HOFs. Risk communication is considered an essential pillar in safety and risk science. This research develops a HOFs-focused risk communication framework based on the NLP techniques that can support risk assessment and mitigation. The proposed approach automatically extracts the target groups oriented “Who, When, Where, Why” (4Ws) information from accident reports. This framework was applied to explore the eMARS database. The results show that the “4Ws” skeleton of narratives has appreciated performance in pattern recognition and holistic information analysis. The graphical representation interfaces are designed to display the features of HOFs-related accidents, which can better be communicated to the sharp-end operators and decision-makers. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology for making sense of the communicative role of data visualizations in journalistic storytelling and share findings from surveying water-related data stories. Data stories are a genre of long-form journalism that integrate text, data visualization, and other visual expressions (e.g., photographs, illustrations, videos) for the purpose of data-driven storytelling. In the last decade, a considerable number of data stories about a wide range of topics have been published worldwide. Authors use a variety of techniques to make complex phenomena comprehensible and use visualizations as communicative devices that shape the understanding of a given topic. Despite the popularity of data stories, we, as scholars, still lack a methodological framework for assessing the communicative role of visualizations in data stories. To this extent, we draw from data journalism, visual culture, and multimodality studies to propose an interpretative framework in six stages. The process begins with the analysis of content blocks and framing elements and ends with the identification of dimensions, patterns, and relationships between textual and visual elements. The framework is put to the test by analyzing 17 data stories about water-related issues. Our observations from the survey illustrate how data visualizations can shape the framing of complex topics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Authors use various media formats to convey disease information to a broad audience, from articles and videos to interviews or documentaries. These media often include human characters, such as patients or treating physicians, who are involved with the disease. While artistic media, such as hand-crafted illustrations and animations are used for health communication in many cases, our goal is to focus on data-driven visualizations. Over the last decade, narrative visualization has experienced increasing prominence, employing storytelling techniques to present data in an understandable way. Similar to classic storytelling formats, narrative medical visualizations may also take a human character-centered design approach. However, the impact of this form of data communication on the user is largely unexplored. This study investigates the protagonist's influence on user experience in terms of engagement, identification, self-referencing, emotional response, perceived credibility, and time spent in the story. Our experimental setup utilizes a character-driven story structure for disease stories derived from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Using this structure, we generated three conditions for a cerebral small vessel disease story that vary by their protagonist: (1) a patient, (2) a physician, and (3) a base condition with no human protagonist. These story variants formed the basis for our hypotheses on the effect of a human protagonist in disease stories, which we evaluated in an online study with 30 participants. Our findings indicate that a human protagonist exerts various influences on the story perception and that these also vary depending on the type of protagonist. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We present Roslingifier, a data-driven storytelling method for animated scatterplots. Like its namesake, Hans Rosling (1948-2017), a professor of public health and a spellbinding public speaker, Roslingifier turns a sequence of entities changing over time - such as countries and continents with their demographic data - into an engaging narrative elling the story of the data. This data-driven storytelling method with an in-person presenter is a new genre of storytelling technique and has never been studied before. In this article, we aim to define a design space for this new genre - data presentation - and provide a semi-automated authoring tool for helping presenters create quality presentations. From an in-depth analysis of video clips of presentations using interactive visualizations, we derive three specific techniques to achieve this: natural language narratives, visual effects that highlight events, and temporal branching that changes playback time of the animation. Our implementation of the Roslingifier method is capable of identifying and clustering significant movements, automatically generating visual highlighting and a narrative for playback, and enabling the user to customize. From two user studies, we show that Roslingifier allows users to effectively create engaging data stories and the system features help both presenters and viewers find diverse insights. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Researchers have reported that the out-of-school issue results from multiple factors; however, few studies have explored how the interactions of these factors lead to children becoming OOSC. This study aimed to explore the causes of out-of-school issues among children with SMD in China based on game theory. Interview data from six parents of children with SMD who had become OOSC were collected as the primary source of research data, with interview data from school personnel at the six schools that children with SMD in our study had attended or applied to, education policy documents for children with SMD, and relevant news as secondary sources of research data. Narrative inquiry and thematic analysis were combined to investigate the out-of-school experiences of children with SMD and analyze how the strategic interactions of three “players” (i.e., the policy, schools, and families) led to these children becoming OOSC. The findings indicated that the three players successively interacted with each other by adopting different strategies to pursue their respective goals, and the families of children with SMD inferred by reverse induction that no strategy they adopted would change the outcome of their children becoming OOSC if the strategies of the other players were unchanged. Finally, an innovative cooperation model with an emphasis on the interactions of all players is proposed to address the out-of-school crisis. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper reports on blended learning or online and face-to-face learning practices viewed from lecturers and students’ perspectives at an Indonesian higher education institution. To capture the participants’ experiences, a narrative inquiry approach was adopted to the scope of blended learning in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. In gathering the data, narrative interviews were used with four lecturers and four students. The findings reveal that the EFL lecturers used various online learning platforms in blended learning classes. Furthermore, both the EFL lecturers and students provided positive responses regarding blended learning. However, challenges were highlighted in the process of its implementation. These challenges include limited time allocation, poor internet connection, and students’ self-study unawareness. This paper highlights the need to reschedule proper time allocation, design the best teaching methods and materials in blended learning, provide the best internet connection, and encourage student motivation in blended learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Clear verbal introductions of visualizations to explain how to interpret the visually encoded information are essential to convey the takeaways and avoid misunderstandings. We contribute a series of studies to investigate how to effectively introduce visualizations to the audience with varying degrees of visualization literacy. We begin with understanding how people are introducing visualizations. We crowdsource 110 introductions of visualizations and categorize them based on their content and structures. From these crowdsourced introductions, we identify different introduction strategies and generate a set of introductions for evaluation. We conduct experiments to systematically compare the effectiveness of different introduction strategies across four visualizations with 1,080 participants. We find that introductions explaining visual encodings with concrete examples are the most effective. Our study provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into how to construct effective verbal introductions of visualizations in presentations, inspiring further research in data storytelling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Missing Middle (MM) housing may be critical to address decreasing housing affordability and to achieve critical density in transit-oriented neighborhoods; however, its production is in decline. We report on a case study of housing development around a new light-rail transit line in the Region of Waterloo, Canada, investigating the puzzle of how a residential building boom coincided with decreasing housing affordability. (2) Methods: Following participatory co-creation and communication of background research characterizing housing demand with stakeholder partners, we created a data narrative arguing that MM housing was desired by residents and profitable for developers and then used it to guide semi-structured interviews with planners and real estate industry stakeholders. Based on these interviews, we developed a qualitative system map and causal loop diagrams that demonstrate interactions between key actors (residents, brokers, planners, developers, and investors) as mediated by boundedly rational real estate demand expectations. (3) Results: Our interviews identify multi-faceted barriers, beyond demand perception, to MM housing development. Systems analysis illustrates how high-density, small-unit high-rise development can become locked in, concurrently locking out MM housing. (4) Conclusions: Our research identifies barriers to MM housing supply by articulating the systemic feedbacks between the planning and land/housing market realms and reveals key leverage points, empowering planners to develop policies that catalyze hoped-for housing market supply responses to increase housing affordability. Based on these findings, we suggest targeted interventions: multi-unit base residential zoning, MM site plan typologies, non-profit and co-op financing, unit-mix requirements, pre-build MM condo purchase by municipalities or non-profits, and MM demonstration projects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Visual data storytelling is gaining importance as a means of presenting data-driven information or analysis results, especially to the general public. This has resulted in design principles being proposed for data-driven storytelling, and new authoring tools being created to aid such storytelling. However, data analysts typically lack sufficient background in design and storytelling to make effective use of these principles and authoring tools. To assist this process, we present ChartStory for crafting data stories from a collection of user-created charts, using a style akin to comic panels to imply the underlying sequence and logic of data-driven narratives. Our approach is to operationalize established design principles into an advanced pipeline that characterizes charts by their properties and similarities to each other, and recommends ways to partition, layout, and caption story pieces to serve a narrative. ChartStory also augments this pipeline with intuitive user interactions for visual refinement of generated data comics. We extensively and holistically evaluate ChartStory via a trio of studies. We first assess how the tool supports data comic creation in comparison to a manual baseline tool. Data comics from this study are subsequently compared and evaluated to ChartStory's automated recommendations by a team of narrative visualization practitioners. This is followed by a pair of interview studies with data scientists using their own datasets and charts who provide an additional assessment of the system. We find that ChartStory provides cogent recommendations for narrative generation, resulting in data comics that compare favorably to manually-created ones. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

But students, on average, do not adequately understand the concepts in a large number of science subjects. This is the case with Ethiopia’s students as well. Additionally, conventional instruction is the primary method used by Ethiopian school teachers. This study looked into how tenth grade students’ conceptual grasp of heredity was affected by the context-based Relating, Experiencing, Applying, Cooperating, and Transferring (REACT) technique. A convergent embedded experimental design of a mixed-methods approach was employed. One hundred thirty-one students took part in the study. Students in treatment groups 1 and 2 were taught using the REACT technique and conventional instruction integrated with context-based activities, respectively. The pupils in the comparison group received conventional instruction. Semi-structured interviews, observation, and two-tier multiple-choice tests were used to gather the data. Three types of analysis were performed on the gathered data: narrative analysis, one-way ANOVA, and descriptive analysis. The outcome demonstrated that there were significant mean score differences favoring treatment group 2 between treatment group 2 and the comparison group. However, there was no significant difference between the comparison group and treatment group 1. This suggests that, compared to employing the context-based REACT strategy alone or conventional education alone, integrating conventional instruction with a context-based approach has a much stronger positive impact on students’ conceptual understanding. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Collocated teamwork remains a pervasive practice across all professional sectors. Even though live observations and video analysis have been utilized for understanding embodied interaction of team members, these approaches are impractical for scaling up the provision of feedback that can promote developing high-performance teamwork skills. Enriching spaces with sensors capable of automatically capturing team activity data can improve learning and reflection. Yet, connecting the enormous amounts of data such sensors can generate with constructs related to teamwork remains challenging. This article presents a framework to support the development of human-centered embodied teamwork analytics by 1) enabling hybrid human-machine multimodal sensing; 2) embedding educators' and experts' knowledge into computational team models; and 3) generating human-driven data storytelling interfaces for reflection and decision making. This is illustrated through an in-the-wild study in the context of healthcare simulation, where predictive modeling, epistemic network analysis, and data storytelling are used to support educators and nursing teams. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Interaction is increasingly integrating into data stories to support data exploration and explanation. Interaction can also be combined with the narrative device, breaking the fourth wall (BTFW), to build a deeper connection between readers and data stories. BTFW interaction directly addresses readers by requiring their input. Such user input is then integrated into the narrative or visuals of data stories to encourage readers to inspect the stories more closely. In this work, we explore the design patterns of BTFW interaction commonly used in data stories. Six design patterns were identified through the analysis of 58 high-quality data stories collected from a range of online sources. Specifically, the data stories were categorized using a coding framework, including the input of BTFW interaction provided by readers and the output of BTFW interaction generated by data stories to respond to the input. To explore the benefits as well as concerns of using BTFW interaction, we conducted a three-session user study including the reading, interview, and recall sessions. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has a positive impact on self-story connection, user engagement, and information recall. We also discussed design implications to address the possible negative effects on the interactivity-comprehensibility balance, information privacy, and the learning curve of interaction brought by BTFW interaction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Although important, they are difficult to create, as a variety of interdisciplinary skills, such as data analysis and design, are required. In this work, we introduce Erato, a human-machine cooperative data story editing system, which allows users to generate insightful and fluent data stories together with the computer. Specifically, Erato only requires a number of keyframes provided by the user to briefly describe the topic and structure of a data story. Meanwhile, our system leverages a novel interpolation algorithm to help users insert intermediate frames between the keyframes to smooth the transition. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of the Erato system via a series of evaluations including a Turing test, a controlled user study, a performance validation, and interviews with three expert users. The evaluation results showed that the proposed interpolation technique was able to generate coherent story content and help users create data stories more efficiently. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Scientific knowledge develops through cumulative discoveries that build on, contradict, contextualize, or correct prior findings. Scientists and journalists often communicate these incremental findings to lay people through visualizations and text (e.g., the positive and negative effects of caffeine intake). Consequently, readers need to integrate diverse and contrasting evidence from multiple sources to form opinions or make decisions. However, the underlying mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple visualizations remains under-explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of four experiments ($\mathrm{N}=1166$) in which participants synthesized empirical evidence from a pair of line charts presented sequentially. In Experiment 1, we administered a baseline condition with charts depicting no specific context where participants held no strong belief. To test for the generalizability, we introduced real-world scenarios to our visualizations in Experiment 2 and added accompanying text descriptions similar to online news articles or blog posts in Experiment 3. In all three experiments, we varied the relative direction and magnitude of line slopes within the chart pairs. We found that participants tended to weigh the positive slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the opposite direction (e.g., one positive slope and one negative slope). Participants tended to weigh the less steep slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the same direction (e.g., both positive). Through these experiments, we characterize participants' synthesis behaviors depending on the relationship between the information they viewed, contribute to theories describing underlying cognitive mechanisms in information synthesis, and describe design implications for data storytelling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) have been widely used for high-dimensional (HD) data storytelling because they allow for presenting a large number of dimensions without distortions. The axes ordering in PCP presents a particular story from the data based on the user perception of PCP polylines. Existing works focus on directly optimizing for PCP axes ordering based on some common analysis tasks like clustering, neighborhood, and correlation. However, direct optimization for PCP axes based on these common properties is restrictive because it does not account for multiple properties occurring between the axes, and for local properties that occur in small regions in the data. Also, many of these techniques do not support the human-in-the-loop (HIL) paradigm, which is crucial (i) for explainability and (ii) in cases where no single reordering scheme fits the users' goals. To alleviate these problems, we present PC-Expo, a real-time visual analytics framework for all-in-one PCP line pattern detection and axes reordering. We studied the connection of line patterns in PCPs with different data analysis tasks and datasets. PC-Expo expands prior work on PCP axes reordering by developing real-time, local detection schemes for the 12 most common analysis tasks (properties). Users can choose the story they want to present with PCPs by optimizing directly over their choice of properties. These properties can be ranked, or combined using individual weights, creating a custom optimization scheme for axes reordering. Users can control the granularity at which they want to work with their detection scheme in the data, allowing exploration of local regions. PC-Expo also supports HIL axes reordering via local-property visualization, which shows the regions of granular activity for every axis pair. Local-property visualization is helpful for PCP axes reordering based on multiple properties, when no single reordering scheme fits the user goals. A comprehensive evaluation was done with real users and diverse datasets confirm the efficacy of PC-Expo in data storytelling with PCPs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Through a close examination of seminal content analyses, their methodologies and findings, this article proposes a framework that consolidates dimensional components of data visualisations previously scattered across this body of research. To transition from incidental and essentialist examinations of visual data artefacts towards a systematic and theory-informed exploration, we consider the diagrammatic dimensions of data visualisations. The offered synthesized framework can serve as a starting point for both theory-infused descriptive purposes as well as more theory-guided explorations. The framework is put to the test by analysing 185 visualisations drawn from award-winning data stories. Findings generated through the application of the framework highlight the varied composition of components of data visualisations, though certain combinations of components are prevalent, leading to static categorical comparisons or interactive spatial localization. After all, data artefacts can be understood as problem-posing elements that are the outcome of diagrammatic thinking that journalists employ to communicate claims. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This study aims to generate a scrollytelling vocabulary for newsrooms and creative agencies. By analysing 50 examples, we have identified granular characteristics of scrollytelling elements, or ‘scrollers’, and grouped them into five standard techniques: graphic sequences, animated transitions, panning and zooming, scrolling through movies, and showing and auto-playing animated content.

We intend to identify the aspects augmented reality adds, as narrative possibilities, to data visualization. Particularly, we seek to identify the aspects augmented reality introduces regarding the three dimensions of narrative visualization—view, focus and sequence. For this purpose, we adopted a comparative analysis of a set of fifty case studies, specifically, narrative visualizations using augmented reality from a journalistic scope, where narrative is a key feature. Despite the strong explanatory character that characterizes the set of analyzed cases, which sometimes limits the user’s agency, there is a strong interactive factor. It was found that augmented reality can expand the narrative possibilities in the three dimensions mentioned—view, focus and sequence—but especially regarding visual strategies where simulation plays an essential role. As a visual strategy, simulation can provide the context for communication or be the object of communication itself, as a replica. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The main contribution of this article is an advanced way to visualise data as a data story. We converged paradigms from digital storytelling, serious games, and data visualisation to turn data into useful insights. The creation, management, and analysis of data have been increasingly given more attention in industry and professional practices. However, the potential of packaging data and analytic results into easily digestible and visually explorable content intended for non-professional audiences has not yet been investigated to its full extent. We contributed towards overcoming the gap between data analytics and data presentation. By integrating a story-like environment and entertainment into data visualisation, we explore the possibilities of efficiently communicating data and insights to general audiences in a casual context.

	abstract = {The fidelity provided by rich, nuanced ethics consult narratives does not proscribe efforts to advance the profession by using data to assess performance and demonstrate value. While these two approaches have been described as in conflict with one another, the former sets the bar to which the latter should aim; to achieve this, consult data should, minimally, do two things: (1) tell the story of the case, as best as possible, in language easily accessible to both ethicists and non-ethicists alike; and (2) do so in a way that elements of interest can be aggregated, disambiguated, and analyzed. Here we present a three-component system designed with that in mind. First, the Armstrong Clinical Ethics Coding System (ACECS) produces a set of six codes that tell a simplified story of the case. These six codes form a meta narrative, which, like meta data, can be aggregated, disambiguated, and analyzed. Second, we use a data model to uncover the stories those data tell. The results allow us to understand relationships, recognize patterns, and reveal insights that are otherwise not discoverable when using narratives alone. Third, due to tremendous heterogeneity among cases, we represent findings visually using techniques borrowed from data storytelling, a powerful means to demonstrate the value of a consult service to administrators and others. The ability to derive meta narratives from an aggregate of case narratives allows us to describe, in detail, the work of our consult service in a manner directly comparable to other services that use the system while we preserve unprecedented case-level nuance. If adopted broadly, this functionality suggests a means to undergird the legitimacy of the ethics consult practice itself in an evidence-based manner similar to that which undergirds other domains of healthcare. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Many community-based HIV research studies incorporate principles of greater involvement and meaningful engagement of people living with HIV (GIPA/MEPA) by training people with HIV as peer researchers. Unfortunately, there are still some aspects of research (e.g., quantitative data analysis and interpretation) where many projects fall short in realizing GIPA/MEPA principles. To address these gaps, we developed an eight-week training course that aimed to build the capacity of peer researchers around the understanding and interpretation of quantitative data and incorporating lived experience to increase the impact of the knowledge transfer and exchange phase of a study. Methods: Peer researchers (n = 8) participated from British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario and lessons learned from the training were implemented throughout the dissemination of research findings from the People Living with HIV Stigma Index study. This paper presents the curriculum and main training components, course evaluation results, and challenges and lessons learned. The manuscript was created in collaboration with and includes the perspectives of both the peer researchers involved in the training, as well the course facilitators. Results: Throughout the course, peer researchers’ self-assessed knowledge and understanding of quantitative research and data storytelling improved and, through interactive activities and practice, they gained the confidence to deliver a full research presentation. This improved their understanding of research findings, which was beneficial for discussing results with community partners and study participants. The peer researchers also agreed that learning about integrating lived experience with quantitative data has helped them to make research findings more relatable and convey key messages in a more meaningful way. Conclusions: Our training curriculum provides a template for research teams to build capacity in areas of research where peer researchers and community members are less often engaged. In doing so, we continue to uphold the principles of GIPA/MEPA and enhance the translation of research knowledge in communities most greatly affected. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have identified substantial unmet information needs in people with depression and anxiety. Sufficient information about the disorder, treatment, available services, and strategies for self-management is essential as it may influence quality of care and patients’ quality of life. This scoping review aimed to provide a broad overview of information needs of people with depression and anxiety as well as the sources that they use to seek this information. Methods: We included all primary research published in English that investigated information needs or information sources in people with depression or anxiety, with no restrictions imposed on the study design, location, setting, or participant characteristics. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LISTA, Web of Science) and the grey literature (Google and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant studies published up to November 2021. Two reviewers independently screened articles and extracted data. Narrative synthesis was performed to identify key themes of information needs and information sources. Factors associated with information needs/sources such as demographic variables and symptom severity were also identified. Results: Fifty-six studies (comprising 8320 participants) were included. Information needs were categorised into seven themes, including general facts, treatment, lived experience, healthcare services, coping, financial/legal, and other information. The most frequently reported needs in both people with depression and anxiety were general facts and treatment information. Subclinical samples who self-reported depressive/anxious symptoms appeared less interested in treatment information than patients with clinical diagnoses. Information sources were summarised into five categories: health professionals, written materials, media, interpersonal interactions, and organisational resources. Health professionals and media (including the internet) were the most frequently adopted and preferred sources. Although few studies have examined factors associated with information needs and information sources, there is preliminary evidence that symptom severity and disease subtypes are related to information needs/sources, whereas findings on demographic factors were mixed. Conclusions: Information needs appear to be high in people with depression and anxiety. Future research should examine differences between subgroups and associated factors such as the treatment course. Personalised information provision strategies are also needed to customise information according to individual needs and patient profiles.

This framework can be applied both as a narrative and a visualisation guide within a company’s existing analytics tool. Its benefits for a business mirror the true returns from investing in an experimentation programme — not the percentage lift of a single test treatment, but the application of test results to how the business might de-risk decision-making, optimise marketing efforts, or prioritise its product roadmap. This approach supports experimentation maturity by (1) giving stakeholders access to test learnings, (2) sharing how stakeholders can use learnings, (3) building institutional intuition of how to talk to different customer audiences or develop new products/features, (4) enabling insights to guide next right actions, and (5) helping others understand the potential application of experimentation and the benefits of testing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an innovative design concept for the curation of data, which we call 'Data Story'. We view this as an additional resource for data curation, aimed specifically at supporting the sharing of qualitative and ethnographic data. The Data Story concept is motivated by three elements: 1.The increased attention of funding agencies and academic institutions on Research Data Management and Open Science; 2. our own work with colleagues applying ethnographic research methods; and 3. existing literature that has identified specific challenges in this context. Ongoing issues entailed in dealing with certain contextual factors that are inherent to qualitative research reveal the extent to which we still lack technical design solutions that can support meaningful curation and sharing. Data Story provides a singular way of addressing these issues by integrating traditional data curation approaches, where research data are treated as 'objects' to be curated and preserved according to specific standards, with a more contextual, culturally-nuanced and collaborative organizing layer that can be thought of as a "Story". The concept draws on existing literature on data curation, digital storytelling and Critical Data Studies (CDS). As a possible design solution for Research Data Management and data curation, Data Story offers: 1) a collaborative workflow for data curation; 2) a story-like format that can serve as an organizing principle; 3) a means of enhancing and naturalizing curation practices through storytelling. Data Story is currently being developed for deployment and evaluation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In a data narrative interview study with 26 currently employed participants, we examined risks and harms to individuals and employers when others joined the dots between their online information. We discuss the themes of visibility and self-disclosure, unintentional information leakage and digital privacy literacies constructed from our analysis. We contribute insights not only into people's difficulties in recalling and conceptualising their digital traces but of subsequently envisioning how their online information may be combined, or (re)identified across their traces and address a current gap in research by showing that awareness is lacking around the potential for personal information to be correlated by and made coherent to/by others, posing risks to individuals, employers, and even the state. We touch on inequalities of privacy, freedom and legitimacy that exist for different groups with regard to what they make (or feel compelled to make) available online and we contribute to current methodological work on the use of sketching to support visual sense making in data narrative interviews. We conclude by discussing the need for interventions that support personal reflection on the potential visibility of combined digital traces to spotlight hidden vulnerabilities, and promote more proactive action about what is shared and not shared online. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Data-driven event analysis has gradually become the backbone of modern competitive sports analysis. Increasingly, competitive sports data analysis tasks use computer vision and machine learning models for intelligent data analysis. Existing sports visualization systems focus on the player–team data visualization, which is not intuitive enough for team season win–loss data and game time–series data visualization, and neglects the prediction of all-star players. Methods: This study used an interactive visualization system, the NPIPVis is designed with parallel aggregated ordered hypergraph dynamic hypergraphs, Calliope visualization data story technology, and iStoryline narrative visualization technology to visualize the regular statistics and game time data of players and teams. NPIPVis includes dynamic hypergraphs of team wins and losses and game plot narrative visualization components. In addition, an integrated learning-based all-star player prediction model SRR-voting, which starts from the existing minority and majority samples, was proposed using synthetic minority oversampling technique and RandomUnderSampler methods to generate and eliminate samples of a certain size to balance the number of all-star and average players in the datasets. A random forest algorithm was introduced next to extract and construct the features of players and combined with the voting integrated model to predict the all-star players, using GridSearchCV, to optimize the hyperparameters of each model in integrated learning and then combined with fivefold cross-validation to improve the generalization ability of the model, and, finally, the Shap model was introduced to enhance the interpretability of the model. Results: The experimental results of comparing the SRR-voting model with six common models show that accuracy and F1-score and recall metrics are significantly improved, which verifies the effectiveness and practicality of the SRR-voting model. Conclusions: This paper combines data visualization and machine learning to design a National Basketball Association data visualization system to help the general audience visualize game data and predict all-star players which can be extended to other sports events or related fields. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper explores narrative techniques combined with medical visualizations to tell data-driven stories about diseases for a general audience. The field of medical illustration uses narrative visualization through hand-crafted techniques to promote health literacy. However, data-driven narrative visualization has rarely been applied to medical data. We derived a template for creating stories about diseases and applied it to three selected diseases to demonstrate how narrative techniques could support visual communication and facilitate understanding of medical data. One of our main considerations is how interactive 3D anatomical models can be integrated into the story and whether this leads to compelling stories in which the users feel involved. A between-subject study with 90 participants suggests that the combination of a carefully designed narrative structure, the constant involvement of a specific patient, high-qualitative visualizations combined with easy-to-use interactions, are critical for an understandable story about diseases that would be remembered by participants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

In this design study, we used comics created for human-level climate change influence to promote ideas like future-based thinking, sharing of responsibility, and caring for each other. We also created data visuals that illustrate future consequences of climate change for the purpose of averting negative alternative realities. To see whether our design can affect audience perception of climate change on the human level of goals and desires, we showed the comics to readers unfamiliar with the themes of the stories, presenting them as manga about characters and situations. The survey showed that data stories can affect the way naive readers interpret narratives to align with pro-climate attitudes such as sharing and future-vision, and that readers are focused on the human-level of the data and story as opposed to the physical resource level. Speculative fiction and data visuals provide a potentially effective way to influence individuals’ climate change attitudes by showing alternative realities and attributes of collective responsibility and planning-for-the-future as data stories. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Interactive visualizations play a key part in the exploration and analysis of data, and in the creation of visual data stories. This paper describes a new graph-based framework for developing interactive visualizations for creating coherent visual data stories. We have realized our framework in a prototype tool named Gravity++. Gravity++ uses a novel graph architecture for modeling interaction, data navigation, and changes in visual representation to better communicate findings to an audience. The combination of these graph models provides better support and flexibility for designing interactive visualizations, data navigation, and visual data stories. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework by two example usage scenarios. We also report on an evaluation study conducted with representative participants. All participants successfully created meaningful visual data stories with a high level of complexity. Our results also show that Gravity++ is easy to use and supports the understanding and sense-making of the visual data story creation process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Narrative sensemaking is a fundamental process to understand sequential information. Narrative maps are a visual representation framework that can aid analysts in their narrative sensemaking process. Narrative maps allow analysts to understand the big picture of a narrative, uncover new relationships between events, and model the connection between storylines. We seek to understand how analysts create and use narrative maps in order to obtain design guidelines for an interactive visualization tool for narrative maps that can aid analysts in narrative sensemaking. We perform two experiments with a data set of news articles. The insights extracted from our studies can be used to design narrative maps, extraction algorithms, and visual analytics tools to support the narrative sensemaking process. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) an analysis of how analysts construct narrative maps; (2) a user evaluation of specific narrative map features; and (3) design guidelines for narrative maps. Our findings suggest ways for designing narrative maps and extraction algorithms, as well as providing insights toward useful interactions. We discuss these insights and design guidelines and reflect on the potential challenges involved. As key highlights, we find that narrative maps should avoid redundant connections that can be inferred by using the transitive property of event connections, reducing the overall complexity of the map. Moreover, narrative maps should use multiple types of cognitive connections between events such as topical and causal connections, as this emulates the strategies that analysts use in the narrative sensemaking process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Introduction The first clinical interaction most patients have in the emergency department occurs during triage. An unstructured narrative is generated during triage and is the first source of in-hospital documentation. These narratives capture the patient's reported reason for the visit and the initial assessment and offer significantly more nuanced descriptions of the patient's complaints than fixed field data. Previous research demonstrated these data are useful for predicting important clinical outcomes. Previous reviews examined these narratives in combination or isolation with other free-text sources, but used restricted searches and are becoming outdated. Furthermore, there are no reviews focused solely on nurses' (the primary collectors of these data) narratives. Methods and analysis Using the Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework and PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines, we will perform structured searches of CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, ProQuest Central, Ovid Embase and Cochrane Library (via Wiley). Additionally, we will forward citation searches of all included studies. No geographical or study design exclusion criteria will be used. Studies examining disaster triage, published before 1990, and non-English language literature will be excluded. Data will be managed using online management tools; extracted data will be independently confirmed by a separate reviewer using prepiloted extraction forms. Cohen's kappa will be used to examine inter-rater agreement on pilot and final screening. Quantitative data will be expressed using measures of range and central tendency, counts, proportions and percentages, as appropriate. Qualitative data will be narrative summaries of the authors' primary findings. Patient and public involvement No patients involved. Ethics and dissemination No ethics approval is required. Findings will be submitted to peer-reviewed conferences and journals. Results will be disseminated using individual and institutional social media platforms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The Washington Post's Fatal Force fatal police shooting database was first created in 2015 to fill a gap in official data collection on police use of force. Literature review: Critical data studies scholarship suggests that data system design is rhetorical and communicates cultural values, not just numerical data. Narrative research methods, which focus on thick, rich contextual data, could help address the rhetorical and cultural dimensions of data system design. Research questions: 1. How do data collection, aggregation, and curation practices influence data stories about crime and violence? 2. How does Fatal Force, a data system about police use of force that originated outside law enforcement, prioritize and organize information? 3. How does designing data systems with explicit, highly specific goals and aims (like the inclusion criteria and purpose of Fatal Force) influence the system as a whole? Methodology: Using 'unblackboxing,' a combination of narrative and critical data studies methods, I analyzed the Fatal Force database and its accompanying data stories. I compare this database with its institutional counterpart in the FBI's fledgling Use of Force database. Results: Fatal Force is constructed with particular attention to questions that users may have about police brutality, police shootings, and race. Fatal Force's data stories use narrative commonplaces like sociality and temporality to humanize the issue of police use of force and communicate greater nuance. The FBI's Use of Force database shows an orientation toward police perceptions of use-of-force incidents and a lack of attention to national conversations about police brutality. Conclusions: Data systems show clear perspectives on the issues that they describe, which influence how users encounter the data system, how useful the system can be for various users, and how inclusive or just the data system is. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

This paper pieces together disparate data to understand why farm operators in the most productive agricultural systems on the planet are systematically losing money. The data-driven narrative we present highlights some troubling trends in US farm operator livelihoods. Though US farms are more productive than ever before, rising input costs, volatile production values, and rising land rents have left farmers with unprecedented levels of farm debt, low on-farm incomes, and high reliance on federal programs. For many US farm operators, the indicators of a “good livelihood”—stability, security, equitable rewards for work—are largely absent. We conclude by proposing three axes of intervention that would help US agriculture better sustain all farmers' livelihoods, a crucial step toward improving overall agricultural sustainability: (1) increase the diversity of people, crops, and cropping systems, (2) improve equity in access to land, support, and capital, and (3) improve the quality, accessibility, and content of data to facilitate monitoring of multiple indicators of agricultural “success.”. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The research developed in this study introduces an integrated methodological framework that analyses sensor data on air pollution distributed in space and time, combined with health data and social data narratives that reflect how different communities perceive this phenomenon in space and time; exploring how these different heterogeneous sources can be combined to better understand the impact of air pollution phenomena at the large-city level in the Valley of Mexico. We introduce a Spatio-temporal data integration and mining framework that aims to discover trends and insights regarding the distribution of the impact of an air pollution phenomenon in terms of human health and perception. The main peculiarity of our methodological framework is the integration of different large data sources by combining a series of methods: NLP (topic modeling), data mining (data cubes, unsupervised learning, and clustering), and GIS capabilities (spatial interpolation, choropleth maps) that together provide a better understanding of the quantitative and qualitative patterns emerging at a different spatial scale and temporal granularity. Overall, this shows how social data, when combined with quantitative data, can provide a better understanding of the impact of a given phenomenon, such as air pollution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Narratives are stories that give the possibility of understanding and interpreting reality on both an individual and collective level. They are present in everyday communication and incorporate a normative perspective. Narratives are characterised by a specific kind of syntax: Current societal events are often processed in narrative form by interrelating them with past events and identifying important actors. Narratives play a central role in the construction of political behaviour and political communication as well. With the rise of populism in the last few decades, the relationship of language and politics has be- come more prominent in public discussion. Besides the oversimplification of most societal problems resulting from the antagonism between the elite and the people, the usage of especially polarising and emotional rhetoric is attributed to populism. While this kind of populist communication is frequently studied, narratives are seldom part of these analyses. Hence, this article turns to the inductive analysis of narrative structures in the election campaign of the currently most successful populist party in Germany, the Alternative for Germany (AfD). Their 2017 federal election campaign on Facebook serves as a database for the qualitative analysis following the Grounded Theory Method. This method is especially suitable for data-driven narrative analysis since it is designed to help identify underlying meaning and rhetorical structures. Ultimately, the underlying narrative of the election campaign is extracted, which shows the AfD’s ideological alignment and thus its interpretation of reality. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The extent to which data visualizations are used, and the quality of these visualizations, has consistently been shown to influence human decision-making relative to static (non-visual) presentations of findings or ideas (Boldosova & Luoto, 2019; El-Wakeel et al., 2020; Liem et al., 2020). Why are visualizations so impactful? Likely because most decision-makers do not want to sort through spreadsheets or read a novel-length narrative to understand what is important—they want it straight and quick. They want color, novelty, storytelling, and interactivity (Dykes, 2020; Kostelnick, 2016; Kosara & MacKinley, 2013). This is the purpose of data storytelling: to literally tell a story about the data analyses to, in some way, impart knowledge or affect change among the audience. Data and data analysis are never neutral—they are always political–and storytelling is how the data analyst can attempt to influence how data findings are perceived by the audience. This paper discusses the basis of data storytelling and why it is important for creating a narrative around data visualizations that compels readers and viewers to act upon findings. It then discusses (in the form of a reflective discussion) how the art of data storytelling may be improved and activated to promote social justice themes by reflecting on the effectiveness of storytelling in hip hop music. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Public procurement is a large market affecting almost every organisation and individual; therefore, governments need to ensure its efficiency, transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive, and vibrant economies. In this context, open data initiatives and integration of data from multiple sources across national borders could transform the procurement market by such as lowering the barriers of entry for smaller suppliers and encouraging healthier competition, in particular by enabling cross-border bids. Increasingly more open data is published in the public sector; however, these are created and maintained in siloes and are not straightforward to reuse or maintain because of technical heterogeneity, lack of quality, insufficient metadata, or missing links to related domains. To this end, we developed an open linked data platform, called TheyBuyForYou, consisting of a set of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse, and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement knowledge graph. We developed advanced tools and services on top of the knowledge graph for anomaly detection, cross-lingual document search, and data storytelling. This article describes the TheyBuyForYou platform and knowledge graph, reports their adoption by different stakeholders and challenges and experiences we went through while creating them, and demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for enhancing public procurement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Narrative visualizations are useful, but common examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story's narrative; it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries. This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false positives and improves average precision by 41% while reducing average incident report size up to 79%. Together, the visualization and summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Misérables character interaction graph. We find that the list of main characters in the automatically generated summary has substantial agreement with human-generated summaries.

The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We present a design study where we introduced visual provenance and analytics to urban transportation planning. Maintaining the provenance of all analyses was critical to support collaborative sensemaking among the many and diverse stakeholders. Our system, STORYFACETS, exposes several different views of the same analysis session, each view designed for a specific audience: (1) the trail view provides a data flow canvas that supports in-depth exploration + provenance (expert analysts); (2) the dashboard view organizes visualizations and other content into a space-filling layout to support high-level analysis (managers); and (3) the slideshow view supports linear storytelling via interactive step-by-step presentations (laypersons). Views are linked so that when one is changed, provenance is maintained.

To decelerate and articulate design processes that occurred at the rapid pace of radio production, the sound designer and producer wrote retrospective design accounts. We then revisited the radio pieces through principles drawn from guidance design, data storytelling, visualization literacy, and sound studies. Finally, we speculated how these principles might be applied through interactive, voice-based technologies. First-person methods enabled us to access the implicit knowledge embedded in radio production and translate it to technologies of interest to the human-computer-interaction community, such as voice user interfaces that rely on auditory display. Traditionally, sonification practitioners have focused more on generating sounds than on teaching people how to listen; our process, however, treated sound and narrative as a holistic, sonic-narrative experience. Our first-person retrospection illuminated the role of narrative in designing to support people as they learn to listen to data. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in creating learning analytics feedback interfaces that support students directly. While dashboards and other visualizations are proliferating, the evidence is that many fail to provide meaningful insights that help students reflect productively. The contribution of this article is qualitative and quantitative evidence from two studies evaluating a multimodal teamwork analytics tool in authentic clinical teamwork simulations. Collocated activity data are rendered to help nursing students reflect on errors and stress-related incidents during simulations. The user interface explicitly guides student reflection using data storytelling principles, tuned to the intended learning outcomes. The results demonstrate the potential of interfaces that 'tell one data story at a time,' by helping students to identify misconceptions and errors; think about strategies they might use to address errors, and reflect on their arousal levels. The results also illuminate broader issues around automated formative assessment, and the intelligibility and accountability of learning analytics. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of big data and business analytics practices, data storytelling has gained increasing importance as an effective means for communicating analytical insights to the target audience to support decision-making and improve business performance. However, there is a limited empirical understanding of the relationship between data storytelling competency, decision-making quality, and business performance. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), this study develops and validates the concept of data storytelling competency as a multidimensional construct consisting of data quality, story quality, storytelling tool quality, storyteller skills, and storyteller domain knowledge. It also develops a mediation model to examine the relationship between data storytelling competency and business performance, and whether this relationship is mediated by decision-making quality. Based on an empirical analysis of data collected from business analytics practitioners, the results of this study reveal that the data storytelling competency is positively linked to business performance, which is partially mediated by decision-making quality. These results provide a theoretical basis for further investigation of possible antecedents and consequences of data storytelling competency. They also offer guidance for practitioners on how to leverage data storytelling capabilities in business analytics practices to improve decision-making and business performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Experiences calling for meaning-making, such as encountering moral dilemmas or existential issues, are ineluctable in the everyday circumstances of persons on a geriatric ward, both patients and professionals. Narratives are a key form for constructing meaning and a powerful tool for expressing and understanding subjective experiences related to living and ageing. Furthermore, narratives can contribute to shifting healthcare towards a more person-centred and humane practice. However, there seems to be tension between individualistic and relational understandings of narratives in healthcare, which raises questions about how to access the experiences and stories of older persons in clinical practice. Using ethnographic data, narrative theory and an interpretative methodology, this study explores how narrative meaning-making processes take place and unfold in everyday practice on a geriatric ward, framed in terms of contextual conditions and person-centred care. Our findings are portrayed in narrative vignettes built around everyday situations on the ward and contribute to a processual understanding of how narrative meaning-making and person-centredness may interrelate and come about in everyday practice. Narrative meaning-making can be understood as an essentially intersubjective and ongoing practice that takes place in seemingly mundane activities, and it engages multiple persons whose meaning-making processes are interconnected and mutually affected by one another. An awareness of the opportunities for narrative meaning-making that exist within the interstices of more traditional healthcare procedures reveals neglected spaces for meaning-making, storytelling and partnership. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Studies abound on international migration and remittances across the world and studies are particularly not lacking on the subject in Africa. There are however few studies on the moderating roles of information communication technology (ICT) and social media in the relationships among international migration, remittances and relationships in Sub-Saharan Africa. This article examines the dimension of ICT and social media in migration studies. This is an aspect that has often been ignored and overlooked even though ICT and social media have great contributions in the international migration process particularly as migrants and relatives in sending and receiving countries both have the primary experience. Research objectives include: reasons for emigration; information technology/social media used by migrants and their kin as they relate across spaces; and how ICT affects relationships of kin and international migrants. Secondary data were gathered through journals, books, documents and reliable Internet sources. Primary data were gathered in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2018 through 30 in-depth interviews analysed through content analysis. Findings reveal the nature of ICT used by international migrants and their kin and purpose of utilization and the effects of ICT on international migration, remittances and kinship networks. The article presents detailed data, narratives, interpretations and implications of relationships among international migration, ICT/social media and kinship networks. This article argues that ICT/social media is central to international migration decision-making, access of migrants and kin to social forces and factors motivating international migration, and it is very important to how migrants and kin maintain and/or weaken relationships and access to remittances and utilization. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We study the effectiveness of adaptive interventions at helping users process textual documents with embedded visualizations, a form of multimodal documents known as Magazine-Style Narrative Visualizations (MSNVs). The interventions are meant to dynamically highlight in the visualization the datapoints that are described in the textual sentence currently being read by the user, as captured by eye-tracking. These interventions were previously evaluated in two user studies that involved 98 participants reading excerpts of real-world MSNVs during a 1-hour session. Participants' outcomes included their subjective feedback about the guidance, and well as their reading time and score on a set of comprehension questions. Results showed that the interventions can increase comprehension of the MSNV excerpts for users with lower levels of a cognitive skill known as visualization literacy. In this article, we aim to further investigate this result by leveraging eye-tracking to analyze in depth how the participants processed the interventions depending on their levels of visualization literacy. We first analyzed summative gaze metrics that capture how users process and integrate the key components of the narrative visualizations. Second, we mined the salient patterns in the users' scanpaths to contextualize how users sequentially process these components. Results indicate that the interventions succeed in guiding attention to salient components of the narrative visualizations, especially by generating more transitions between key components of the visualization (i.e., datapoints, labels, and legend), as well as between the two modalities (text and visualization). We also show that the interventions help users with lower levels of visualization literacy to better map datapoints to the legend, which likely contributed to their improved comprehension of the documents. These findings shed light on how adaptive interventions help users with different levels of visualization literacy, informing the design of personalized narrative visualizations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Narrative visualization in immersive environments can provide users with an intuitive experience to interactively explore the scientific data, because immersive environments provide a brand new strategy for interactive scientific data visualization and exploration. However, it is challenging to develop narrative scientific visualization in immersive environments. In this article, we propose an immersive narrative visualization tool to create and customize scientific data explorations for ordinary users with little knowledge about programming on scientific visualization. They are allowed to define point of interests (POIs) conveniently by the handler of an immersive device. Results: Automatic exploration animations with narrative annotations can be generated by the gradual transitions between consecutive POI pairs. Besides, interactive slicing can be also controlled by device handler. Evaluations including user study and case study are designed and conducted to show the usability and effectiveness of the proposed tool. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The wide availability of affordable tracking devices facilitates monitoring the position along with the race of all participants, even for non-professional contests. Getting real-time information of contenders is useful but also unleashes the possibility of creating more complex visualization systems that ease the understanding of the behavior of all participants during a simple stage or throughout the whole competition. In this paper we focus on bicycle races, which are highly popular, especially in Europe, being the Tour de France its greatest exponent. Current visualizations from TV broadcasting or real-time tracking websites are useful to understand the current stage status, up to a certain extent. Unfortunately, still no current system exists that visualizes a whole multi-stage contest in such a way that users can interactively explore the relevant events of a single stage (e.g. breakaways, groups, virtual leadership…), as well as the full competition. In this paper, we present an interactive system that is useful both for aficionados and professionals to visually analyze the development of multi-stage cycling competitions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We conducted a user study during which participants read a set of MSNVs with our interventions, and compared their performance and experience with participants who received no interventions. Our work extends previous findings by showing that dynamic, gaze-driven interventions can be delivered based on reading behaviors in MSNVs, a widespread form of documents that have never been considered for gaze-driven adaptation so far. Next, we found that the interventions significantly improved the performance of users with low levels of visualization literacy, i.e., those users who need help the most due to their lower ability to process and understand data visualizations. However, high literacy users were not impacted by the interventions, providing initial evidence that gaze-driven interventions can be further improved by personalizing them to the levels of visualization literacy of their users. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of data-driven narratives to examine how the use of infor-mation, communications, and media technologies (ICMTs) impacts the sustainable growth of econ-omies. While ICMTs have regularly been advocated as a policy tool for growth and development, there is a research gap in empirical studies validating how such policies may be effective. This analysis is based on historical panel data from 39 economies across the developed North (19) and developing South (20). The industry-standard Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology was applied to construct narratives that weave extant theories with empirical data. The art of developing data-driven narratives is rarely addressed in previous research articles. In the narrative approach, prior research on how ICMTs and sustainable growth are quantitatively scored and measured is reviewed. Panel data from authoritative sources such as the United Nations, World Economic Forum, and Sustainable Society Index were collected, cleansed, and conglomer-ated for data analytics. This was followed by evidence-based reasoning to examine any possible relationships between ICMT development and the sustainable growth of economies across the “North” and “South”. The findings reveal that there are differentiated outcomes in sustainable growth in high-and low-income economies. This poses legitimate questions as to whether low-income economies will be able to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 through the intermediation of ICMTs. It is the intended contribution of this paper to exemplify how data-driven narratives using CRISP may construct rich stories about ICMT for sustainability for the pur-poses of sharing good practice as well as lessons learned. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The current paper focuses on the development of an enhanced Mobile Journalism (MoJo) model for soundscape heritage crowdsourcing, data-driven storytelling, and management in the era of big data and the semantic web. Soundscapes and environmental sound semantics have a great impact on cultural heritage, also affecting the quality of human life, from multiple perspectives. In this view, context-and location-aware mobile services can be combined with state-of-the-art machine and deep learning approaches to offer multilevel semantic analysis monitoring of sound-related heritage. The targeted utilities can offer new insights toward sustainable growth of both urban and rural areas. Much emphasis is also put on the multimodal preservation and auralization of special soundscape areas and open ancient theaters with remarkable acoustic behavior, representing important cultural artifacts. For this purpose, a pervasive computing architecture is deployed and investigated, utilizing both client-and cloud-wise semantic analysis services, to implement and evaluate the envisioned MoJo methodology. Elaborating on previous/baseline MoJo tools, research hypotheses and questions are stated and put to test as part of the human-centered application design and development process. In this setting, primary algorithmic backend services on sound semantics are implemented and thoroughly validated, providing a convincing proof of concept of the proposed model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Causality visualization can help people understand temporal chains of events, such as messages sent in a distributed system, cause and effect in a historical conflict, or the interplay between political actors over time. However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We validate Causeworks through interviews with experts who used the system for understanding complex events. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Our exhibit sought to communicate new lessons based on scientific findings from the domain of metagenomics. This multi-user exhibit had three goals: (1) to inform the public about microbial communities and their daily cycles; (2) to link microbes' activity to the concept of gene expression; (3) and to highlight scientists' use of gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. To address these three goals, we derived visualization designs with three corresponding stories, each corresponding to a goal. We present three successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to convey these goals. We could successfully present one story but had limited success with our second and third goals.

	abstract = {Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content. Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for 'data-GIFs'. To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108 data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core message.

However, creating such a story is usually laborious and tedious, because narrators have to switch between different tools and discuss with different collaborators. To reduce the burden, we develop a prototype system to help explore the bubbles’ movement by automatically inserting animations connected to the storytelling of the video creators and the interaction of viewers to those videos. We demonstrate the usability of our method through both use cases and a semi-structured user study.

In the digital era, it is necessary to deploy dashboards and visual items to assist users in obtaining information more quickly. Typically, the dashboard comprises relevant charts and graphics. In this study, a Sankey chart is recommended. The purpose of this project is to simulate the construction of a dashboard that supports users at credit agencies or financial institutions in detecting credit card payment defaults. User requirements, data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data treatment, modelling, and assessment are all part of the development process. It is recommended to use a Sankey chart to examine patterns based on delayed monthly patterns. The result of this study shows that the largest percentage (71%) of the clients who do not have default payments in the coming month are those who are using revolving credit, paying duly, or those who do not consume the credit card. The usability assessment yielded a 4.0 mean on a five-point Likert scale which indicates that respondents agree that the dashboard is usable. In future development, a prediction model will be created and included into the default payment indicator. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Innovation in journalism became an important element to determine the current and future direction of the profession. Through incremental and cumulative transformations over time, because of many obstacles faced inside the newsrooms, journalism has suffered from significant and fundamental changes, including the deployment of data journalism. In Latin America, the practice has seen an increasing expansion in the last years. Nevertheless, there are important technological gaps that limit its development. The present study draws upon literature on data journalism, media management, and sociology, aiming to contribute theoretically to data journalism research. Our findings show that beyond the technological approach, practitioners are relying on data evangelists, collaboration, and audience-centered innovation to produce data storytelling in their newsrooms. On the other hand, these alliances form “homophily” and “endogamy” features that limit the dissemination of the practice, which must consider the potential implications for the social distance of the audiences. It argues that Latin American professionals are distancing themselves from technological determinism to embrace a more audience-centric innovation in newsrooms. Finally, it also states that it is important to take into account those limitations, as they pose obstacles for data journalism innovation research knowledge.

Storytelling is a form of teaching and learning because it asks the readers or listeners to replace well-established explanations that are considered facts with new, unexpected ones. We always learn new things when listening to good stories. Good stories do so by violating expectations and surprising the listener or the reader. Surprise breeds suspense, which generates engagement, which is a catalyst for learning–even truer for scientific and data-driven stories. In this paper we show how understanding the nature of good stories by focusing on the novelty they introduce and assumption they violate helps us to do effective scientific work and tell excellent data-based stories. We start by providing definitions of “story,” “storytelling,” and “good stories.” We then outline a methodology for building stories and provide an illustrative example of an effective data-based story from the history of medicine. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Emerging narratives call for recognising and engaging constructively with small-scale farmers who have a leading role in shaping the current irrigation dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper explores whether new irrigation data can usefully inform these narratives. It argues that, for a variety of reasons, official irrigation data in sub-Saharan Africa fail to capture the full extent and diverse nature of irrigation and its rapid distributed growth over the last two decades. The paper investigates recent trends in the use of remote sensing methods to generate irrigation data; it examines the associated expectation that these techniques enable a better understanding of current irrigation developments and small-scale farmers’ roles. It reports on a pilot study that uses radar-based imagery and analysis to provide new insights into the extent of rice irrigated agriculture in three regions of Tanzania. We further stress that such mapping exercises remain grounded in a binary logic that separates 'irrigation' from other 'non-irrigated' landscape features. They can stem from, and reinforce, a conventional understanding of irrigation that is still influenced by colonial legacies of engineering design and agricultural modernisation. As farmers’ initiatives question this dominant view of irrigation, and in a policy context that is dominated by narratives of water scarcity, this means that new data may improve the visibility of water use by small-scale irrigators but may also leave them more exposed to restrictions favouring more powerful water users. The paper thus calls for moving away from a narrow debate on irrigation data and monitoring, and towards a holistic discussion of the nature of irrigation development in sub-Saharan Africa. This discussion is necessary to support a constructive engagement with farmer-led irrigation development; it is also challenging in that it involves facing entrenched vested interests and requires changes in development practices. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background There are many cases in which experts work collaboratively in the workplace. The proportion of workplace meetings continues to increase. The purpose of this study is to develop a visualization system that summarizes meetings, which occur in the workplace. Methods We confirmed that meetings can be classified into discussion-centered and topic-oriented types. These are proceeded with the review on studies of office meeting analysis. To devise a method of summarizing contents of meetings, we selected the visualization method. A narrative chart technique was selected for the summary visualization of the discussion-centered meeting, and a topic map technique was selected for the summary visualization of the topic-oriented meeting. Design tasks were selected according to their requirements through discussions with domain experts and a visualization expert. Results We conducted two controlled usability tests using actual meeting data. Narrative chart–based visualization was proven to effectively provide a general overview of the meeting and the participants’ utterance patterns. Topic map-based visualization demonstrated that the contents of the meeting can be inferred through the relationship between the information on various keywords. Conclusions This study proposed a meeting summary visualization system that is suitable for different workplace meeting types based on the requirements of meeting records and meeting type classification. Two visualization methods were developed to overcome the limitations of the previous one that provides all meeting summary information in one system without considering the differences in the characteristics of the meeting types. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

However, the role of interactivity and narration are often overlooked when designing and analyzing personal data physicalizations. We introduce Narrative Physicalizations, everyday objects modified to support nuanced self-reflection through embodied engagement with personal data. Narrative physicalizations borrow from narrative visualizations, storytelling with graphs, and engagement with mundane artifacts from data-objects. Our research uses a participatory approach to research-through-design and includes two interdependent studies. In the first, personalized data physicalizations are developed for three individuals. In the second, we conduct a parallel autobiographical exploration of what constitutes personal data when using a Fitbit. Our work expands the landscape of data physicalization by introducing narrative physicalizations. It suggests an experience-centric view on data physicalization where people engage physically with their data in playful ways, making their body an active agent during the reflective process. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

In doing so, I particularly focus on the materiality of listening, the force of corporeal voices, the rhythms of oral narratives and their effects on understanding and making connections within the web of human relations. Following tracks and traces of a rich body of literature around sounds, voices and texts in narrative analytics and feminist theory, I have turned my attention to aurality and I have suggested narrative rhythmanalysis as a mode of understanding and as a method. What I argue is that turning our attention to listening practices as a neglected process in theoretical analysis illuminates the perspective of the storyteller, mobilizes affective forces in the milieu of relational narratives and enacts the materiality of knowledge through the intensity and uniqueness of the corporeal voice. What I finally suggest is that perhaps we should move beyond the imperatives of clarity and transparency in an attempt to be in the world with others. Here the sound of narratives could become a trope that can take us down the path of decolonizing our ways of knowing and understanding. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {So far, studies on wildlife poaching in Nigeria have focused on its health implications, motivations, and rationalizations. The methods of operation employed by the poachers to thwart enforcement of anti-poaching laws have not been examined. It is in an attempt to bridge this gap that this study examined wildlife poaching at the Kainji National Park (KNP) Kwara State, from the poachers’ perspective and the various attendant schemes employed by the poachers to evade arrest and prosecution. This study interrogated how enforcement of laws against criminalized acts could be frustrated through adoption of schemes to evade arrest and prosecution, if a cultural group defines such criminalization as an incursion on their cultural heritage. It also examined forces propelling wildlife poaching at the Park. The study is of the firm believe that knowledge of these schemes would be useful to park rangers in adopting a more effective approach to tackle the crime. Knowledge of the cultural forces propelling poaching would also be useful to the government in initiating appropriate approaches to address them. The exploratory research design was employed for the study while the qualitative method was used to collect primary data. Narratives were generated through in-depth interviews with wildlife poachers at Kaiama community. Findings from the study showed that community rationalization and justification of hunting as their heritage, and perception of establishment of KNP as an incursion on their heritage was a major force propelling illegal hunting while the consequent tactics adopted by the poachers to evade arrest were: use of mystical powers, decimation of vultures, bribery, use of community residents as informants, prediction of park rangers’ movements, sale of hunted animals to only familiar customers and new customers introduced by old customers, and utilization of their mastery of the forest environment. Poachers remain persistent in the act due to availability of a variety of animals to poach, and corruption among the park rangers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

Narratives were analyzed to reach interpretation. Findings: Interview results identified four themes, namely, relevance and applicability of training received, the formation of attitudes and preferences among the trainee participants, immediacy in the use of the training received and relational and organizational influence that furthers leader-member exchange in the workplace. Research limitations/implications: This study examined participants’ perspectives in workplace training and provides support for further research: examining communication’s role in workplace learning; exploring the training process; and positioning the trainer as an organizational leader. Practical implications: This study provides empirical data to support changes in instructional communication models and exploring the process of training. Trainers’ relational building with trainees could impact many outcomes in their training efforts that are detailed in this study.

However, there is no prior research that systematically investigates how to augment such short videos with data visualizations in an effective way. We conducted a design workshop with experienced video, animation designers and visualization experts to discuss principles and practices for augmenting short-form videos with data visualizations. After the workshop, we summarized the participants’ design considerations and proposed 20 design guidelines. We further collected design purposes of the participants and associated these purposes with the guidelines. Finally, we conducted a crowd-sourcing study and a task-based evaluation to validate the effectiveness and usability of the guidelines. Results indicate that our guidelines can significantly improve the videos accompanied with data visualizations and help novices easily obtain desired knowledge when augmenting videos.

	abstract = {A growing number of scientific publications is available to promote sustainable river management. However, these publications target researchers rather than water management professionals who are responsible for the implementation of management practices. To bridge this science-to-practice gap, we conceptualize and propose a series of steps to prepare effective storylines targeted at a practitioner audience. We developed this approach within a research program that supports integrated and collaborative river management. We prepared three storylines, each based on one scientific publication. The storylines combined text and interactive visuals using the ESRI StoryMaps tool to make them available online. Via focus groups with 44 participants from research and practice, we evaluated the perceived usefulness of and engagement with the content and design. We collected feedback from participants using a survey as well as via audio and screen recordings. Our findings show that we should narrow down the audience of the storylines by tailoring them to the needs of project managers rather than specialized advisors. Therefore, the content should offer more than a visual summary of the research by showing examples of the management application. A more engaging sequence with a clear protagonist is further required to better relate to the problem and the potential application. Although visuals and interactive elements were considered attractive, a multi-disciplinary editorial team is necessary to better complement the visuals’ design to the text. The level of detail of participants’ feedback shows that involving project managers to co-create storylines can be an important step for improvement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

We compare (a) personal visual narratives designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of aggregates of people; and (c) an exploratory visualization without narrative acting as a control condition. We conducted two crowdsourced between-subject studies comparing the three conditions, each with 300 participants. To assess the differences in attitudes between conditions, we adopted established scales from the social sciences used in the European Social Survey (ESS). Although we found some differences between conditions, the effects on people's attitudes are smaller than we expected. Our findings suggest that we need to be more careful when it comes to our expectations about the effects visual data storytelling can have on attitudes.

	abstract = {Visual data stories have been shown to significantly aid the comprehension and short-term memorability of statistical facts and value messages. Hence, they are a promising medium for communicating complex information to a target audience, fulfilling the communicative goal of information visualisation. However, creating visual data stories often requires a plethora of tools to execute the visual data story creation process – creating visualisations, developing a logical connection between visualisations, and presenting the story based on the meaningfully sequenced visualisations. Current information visualisation tools either focus primarily on exploration or lack sequencing models for visualisation presentation, even though transitioning and sequencing have been shown to affect user understanding and interpretation of visualisations. We present Gravity, a system that consolidates the different phases of the visual data story creation process, and recommends and visualises logically sequenced sets of interactive visualisations to support the presentation of coherent narratives and visual data stories. We also report on an evaluation study with representative participants. Our results show that participants learned to use the system within a short time and successfully created visual data stories with minimal guidance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the changes of time-series is a common task in many application domains. Converting time-series data into videos helps an audience with little or no background knowledge gain insights and deep impressions. It essentially integrates data visualizations and animations to present the evolution of data expressively. However, it remains challenging to create this kind of data video. First, it is difficult to efficiently detect important changes and include them in the video sequence. Existing methods require much manual effort to explore the data and find changes. Second, how these changes are emphasized in the videos is also worth studying. A video without emphasis will hinder an audience from noticing those important changes. This article presents an approach that extracts and visualizes important changes of a time-series. Users can explore and modify these changes, and apply visual effects on them. Case studies and user feedback demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Big data are indispensable in scientific endeavours ranging from nuclear research to climate studies. However, there is a growing misperception that congeries of data can be easily reconstructed into competitive business insights. Such notions have been encouraged by a plethora of mainstream techno-utopian forecasts. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigated such claims and related big data developments, including its “systems-first” and oligopolistic orientations. Due to the paucity of current scholarship on an admittedly pessimistic topic, the paper studied contrarian developments in the industry by relying on secondary data. The study of experts and scholars; industrial trends; and discrepancies and critical gaps in the mainstream data narrative were sourced to prognosticate the likely trajectory of many data giants. Findings: A key finding was that the big data industry faces an untenable market bubble worth trillions of dollars. This will have severe consequences for common digital access and social stability worldwide. Evidence presented also suggests that the data industrial complex may undergo a function creep by facilitating a transition from surveillance capitalism to surveillance society. Research limitations/implications: Primary data for a study of this nature may take years to materialize. This is a “first-pass” study that seeks to illuminate latent dangers facing the big data/AI sector. There is a paucity of scholarly study that even remotely touches on this topic. Therefore, supporting arguments was sourced from contemporary reports and expert study (secondary data). Practical implications: As control of data may have geostrategic implications, balkanization of the wired ecosystem may be underway with Russia and China leading the way. Future superpowers may be defined by the way they handle data. The concentration of data in fewer hands may also affect citizen innovation. Social implications: A break-down of the data industrial complex may lead to social mayhem as the monetization of presently free software, blogs and social media platforms may be unfeasible. Originality/value: This topic has hardly been explored due to the novelty of big data, its applications and the daily hype over its potentials. This paper boldly describes dark countercurrents in the industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Language is an essential mode, not only for human communication—but also for thinking. A story is conveyed or a report of an incident is being told, humans perceive the conveyed information in the form of visual insights. The increasing advancements in the field of artificial intelligence can help with the same in machines. This paper reflects on the internalization of stories from a cognitive perspective and outlines a scalable framework for supporting the visualization of narrative text data. This paper leverages natural language processing (NLP), probabilistic modelling of discourse knowledge, information extraction of narrative components (who, where, when, what) and the narrative visualization. The graphics knowledge base storage structure has been redesigned to obviate the necessity of having a larger database for all graphics entity. With the developed framework, any user can input unrestricted natural language for the dynamic generation of animated scenes. This provides users with direct visual output in response to their natural language input. This tool can potentially impact the way humans interact with computers and expand a completely new way of understanding conversations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},

The collection of personal and sensitive data online increases exponentially, and individuals become a series of data points, only of relevance insofar as we are part of a larger group marked by similar characteristics. Yet somewhat contradictorily, we are also scrutinized completely. How might creative media production bridge this gap – recogniz-ing our individual complexity while respecting rights to privacy? Documentary media offers one response – individual stories and voices can serve to flesh out a complex story while retaining links to a broader narrative. Interactive documentary, furthermore, can offer a reflexive form of storytelling that uses the very forms of technology in question to highlight the potential problems. This article presents case studies of interactive documentaries, exploring how the strategies of reflexivity and responsiveness can engender an understanding of issues of digital rights. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.},
