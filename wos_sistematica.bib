Abstract = {Narrative visualization transforms data into engaging stories, making
   complex information accessible to a broad audience. Foundation models,
   with their advanced capabilities such as natural language processing,
   content generation, and multimodal integration, hold substantial
   potential for enriching narrative visualization. Recently, a collection
   of techniques have been introduced for crafting narrative visualizations
   based on foundation models from different aspects. We build our survey
   upon 66 articles to study how foundation models can progressively engage
   in this process and then propose a reference model categorizing the
   reviewed literature into four essential phases: Analysis, Narration,
   Visualization, and Interaction. Furthermore, we identify eight specific
   tasks (e.g., Insight Extraction and Authoring) where foundation models
   are applied across these stages to facilitate the creation of visual
   narratives. Detailed descriptions, related literature, and reflections
   are presented for each task. To make it a more impactful and informative
   experience for diverse readers, we discuss key research problems and
   provide the strengths and weaknesses in each task to guide people in
   identifying and seizing opportunities while navigating challenges in
   this field.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the potential for human-AI collaboration in the
   context of data storytelling for data workers. Data storytelling
   communicates insights and knowledge from data analysis. It plays a vital
   role in data workers' daily jobs since it boosts team collaboration and
   public communication. However, to make an appealing data story, data
   workers need to spend tremendous effort on various tasks, including
   outlining and styling the story. Recently, a growing research trend has
   been exploring how to assist data storytelling with advanced artificial
   intelligence (AI). However, existing studies focus more on individual
   tasks in the workflow of data storytelling and do not reveal a complete
   picture of humans' preference for collaborating with AI. To address this
   gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 data workers to explore
   their preferences for AI collaboration in the planning, implementation,
   and communication stages of their workflow. We propose a framework for
   expected AI collaborators' roles, categorize people's expectations for
   the level of automation for different tasks, and delve into the reasons
   behind them. Our research provides insights and suggestions for the
   design of future AI-powered data storytelling tools.},

Abstract = {In recent years, data-driven stories have found a firm footing in
   journalism, business, and education. They leverage visualization and
   storytelling to convey information to broader audiences. Likewise,
   immersive technologies, like augmented and virtual reality devices,
   provide excellent potential for exploring and explaining data, thus
   inviting research on how data-driven storytelling transfers to immersive
   environments. To gain a better understanding of this exciting novel
   research area, we conducted a scoping review on the emerging notion of
   immersive data-driven storytelling, extended by surveying immersive data
   journalism and by analyzing immersive games, selected based on community
   reviews and tags. We present our methodology for the survey and discuss
   prominent themes that coalesce the knowledge we extracted from the
   literature, journalism, and games. These themes include, among others,
   the spatial embodiment of narration, the incorporation of the users and
   their context into narratives, and the balance between guiding the user
   versus promoting serendipity. Our discussion of these themes reveals
   research opportunities and challenges that will inform the design of
   immersive data-driven stories in the future.},

Abstract = {Data-rich documents are commonly found across various fields such as
   business, finance, and science. However, a general limitation of these
   documents for reading is their reliance on text to convey data and
   facts. Visual representation of text aids in providing a satisfactory
   reading experience in comprehension and engagement. However, existing
   work emphasizes presenting the insights within phrases or sentences,
   rather than fully conveying data stories within the whole paragraphs and
   engaging readers. To provide readers with satisfactory data stories,
   this paper presents Narrative Player, a novel method that automatically
   revives data narratives with consistent and contextualized visuals.
   Specifically, it accepts a paragraph and corresponding data table as
   input and leverages LLMs to characterize the clauses and extract
   contextualized data facts. Subsequently, the facts are transformed into
   a coherent visualization sequence with a carefully designed
   optimization-based approach. Animations are also assigned between
   adjacent visualizations to enable seamless transitions. Finally, the
   visualization sequence, transition animations, and audio narration
   generated by text-to-speech technologies are rendered into a data video.
   The evaluation results showed that the automatic-generated data videos
   were well-received by participants and experts for enhancing reading.},

   narrative climaxes that maximise viewers' emotional engagement remains
   scarce. To address this gap, our work leverages emotional theory to
   derive patterns for crafting emotionally resonant climaxes of data

   them into eight emotional dimensions based on Plutchik's basic emotion
   model. Based on data analysis, we then formulated 40 patterns for
   creating narrative climaxes. To evaluate the patterns when applied as
   design hints, we conducted a user study with 48 participants, where
   Group A created data video climaxes using our patterns, Group B created
   them without our patterns, and Group C used other patterns as the
   baseline. Evaluations by two experts and 20 general audiences revealed
   that the climaxes created with the patterns were more emotionally
   engaging. The participants also praised the clarity and practicality of
   the patterns.},

Abstract = {The integration of visualizations and text is commonly found in data
   news, analytical reports, and interactive documents. For example,
   financial articles are presented along with interactive charts to show
   the changes in stock prices on Yahoo Finance. Visualizations enhance the
   perception of facts in the text while the text reveals insights of
   visual representation. However, effectively combining text and
   visualizations is challenging and tedious, which usually involves
   advanced programming skills. This paper proposes a semi-automatic
   pipeline that builds links between text and visualization. To resolve
   the relationship between text and visualizations, we present a method
   which structures a visualization and the underlying data as a contextual
   knowledge graph, based on which key phrases in the text are extracted,
   grouped, and mapped with visual elements. To support flexible
   customization of text-visualization links, our pipeline incorporates
   user knowledge to revise the links in a mixed-initiative manner. To
   demonstrate the usefulness and the versatility of our method, we
   replicate prior studies or cases in crafting interactive word-sized
   visualizations, annotating visualizations, and creating text-chart
   interactions based on a prototype system. We carry out two preliminary
   model tests and a user study and the results and user feedbacks suggest
   our method is effective.},

Abstract = {Creating data videos that effectively narrate stories with animated
   visuals requires substantial effort and expertise. A promising research
   trend is leveraging the easy-to-use natural language (NL) interaction to
   automatically synthesize data video components from narrative content
   like text narrations, or NL commands that specify user-required designs.
   Nevertheless, previous research has overlooked the integration of
   narrative content and specific design authoring commands, leading to
   generated results that lack customization or fail to seamlessly fit into
   the narrative context. To address these issues, we introduce a novel
   paradigm for creating data videos, which seamlessly integrates users'
   authoring and narrative intents in a unified format called annotated
   narration, allowing users to incorporate NL commands for design
   authoring as inline annotations within the narration text. Informed by a
   formative study on users' preference for annotated narration, we develop
   a prototype system named Data Playwright that embodies this paradigm for
   effective creation of data videos. Within Data Playwright, users can
   write annotated narration based on uploaded visualizations. The system's
   interpreter automatically understands users' inputs and synthesizes data
   videos with narration-animation interplay, powered by large language
   models. Finally, users can preview and fine-tune the video. A user study
   demonstrated that participants can effectively create data videos with
   Data Playwright by effortlessly articulating their desired outcomes
   through annotated narration.},

Abstract = {In a journalism and communication landscape where data plays an
   increasingly important role in crafting reliable and engaging stories,
   data storytelling has become an integral part of the industry.
   Traditionally, journalism has often followed a linear, author-driven,
   and explanatory approach to storytelling. However, the rise of data
   storytelling has prompted a significant shift towards more interactive
   and reader-driven stories, with a higher potential for exploration.
   While the literature in the field has studied aspects such as
   interactivity in data visualisations, linearity and storytelling
   structures, the discourse surrounding exploratory features of data
   stories is relatively recent and scarce, and it remains largely
   unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and studies the exploratory
   and explanatory characteristics of data stories, and their
   interdependencies. It further examines the relationships of these facets
   with other key attributes of data stories, specifically linearity,
   interactivity, and storytelling structures. This is done through
   analysing a broad selection of data stories (N = 118) sourced from a
   variety of news outlets. Results uncover the complementary roles
   exploratory and explanatory characteristics play in data stories, and
   reveal the nuances in relationships with the other three facets. The
   findings provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of data story
   design and practical insights for data journalists seeking to balance
   explanation and exploration in their narratives.},

Month = {2025 AUG 18},
Abstract = {In the context of the exponentially increasing volume of narrative texts
   such as novels and news, readers struggle to extract and consistently
   remember storylines from these intricate texts due to the constraints of
   human working memory and attention span. To tackle this issue, we
   propose a visualization approach StoryExplorer, which facilitates the
   process of knowledge externalization of narrative texts and further
   makes the form of mental models more coherent. Through the formative
   study and close collaboration with two domain experts, we identified key
   challenges for the extraction of the storyline. Guided by the distilled
   requirements, we then propose a set of workflow (i.e., insight
   finding-scripting-storytelling) to enable users to interactively
   generate fragments of narrative structures. We then propose a
   visualization system StoryExplorer that combines stroke annotation and
   GPT-based visual hints to quickly extract story fragments and
   interactively construct storylines. To evaluate the effectiveness and
   usefulness of StoryExplorer, we conducted two case studies and in-depth
   user interviews with 16 target users. The result shows that users can
   conveniently and effectively extract the storyline by using
   StoryExplorer along with the proposed workflow.},

Title = {Timelines: Visualizing time in narrative research},
Journal = {RESEARCH METHODS IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Timelines have been increasingly recognized as valuable tools in
   narrative research for visualizing the temporal dimension of
   participants' lived experiences. This paper offers a comprehensive
   overview of the application of timelines in qualitative narrative
   research, particularly within applied linguistics. Narrative research
   methods inherently focus on time, with timelines serving to highlight
   the temporal aspects of critical life events, transitions, and personal
   transformations. By organizing and representing time visually, timelines
   facilitate deeper reflexivity among participants, offering insights that
   may not emerge through verbal interviews alone. This study synthesizes
   existing research on timelines, exploring their flexible application and
   impact on the quality of narrative data. In applied linguistics,
   timelines have been employed to investigate various aspects of language
   teaching and learning, from tracking long-term language learning
   trajectories to supporting teacher professional development. The paper
   also discusses methodological considerations, such as who constructs the
   timeline, when timelines should be constructed, and the medium used.
   Additionally, it addresses the limitations of timelines, including their
   tendency to present time linearly, which may not capture the complex,
   cyclical nature of human experiences. Drawing on examples from within
   and beyond applied linguistics as well as research with teachers of
   multiple langauges, this paper underscores the potential of timelines to
   enhance the rigor and depth of qualitative narrative research while also
   acknowledging the challenges and limitations inherent in their use.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the use of narrative visualizations as an effective
   way to improve communication, engagement, and knowledge transfer in
   research-practice partnerships (RPPs). I report on the experience of
   developing a narrative visualization reporting research findings to
   educators/school leaders in an RPP focused on providing more equitable
   access to high school mathematics courses for multilingual students
   {[}referred to as English learners (ELs) in the US]. The narrative
   visualization was intended to allow easy interpretation of information
   on: (i) student rates of completion of courses that are critical to
   becoming eligible for college admission; (ii) student mathematics course
   trajectories; and (iii) mathematics course placement decisions. Using
   the notion of graphical excellence, I identify specific visualization
   strategies and features that improve the quality of the narrative
   visualization and support practitioners use of them. Drawing on
   liberatory design thinking, I discuss how this form of reporting
   findings builds trust and facilitates engagement between partners,
   increases practitioners' agency, and thus creates more equitable power
   dynamics in RPPs and for the multilingual students at the core of the
   one discussed here.},

Abstract = {PurposeEmbedded in historical research is distance. For qualitative
   researchers, this distance is temporal and affective and can
   decontextualise the interpretation and analysis of the data and render
   the researcher's position and emotions invisible. In this article we
   draw - literally - on a research project to show how drawings create a
   bridge between a historical event and a contemporary analysis, providing
   analytic and reflexive possibilities. We show how the use of drawings
   allowed the researcher to stay present and pay attention to the finer
   details in the data that led to a contextual understanding as well as an
   interrogation of that context.Design/methodology/approachThe research
   project focused on examining how a historical event unfolded in the
   public news reporting. A traditional archival data collection method was
   used, with research drawings produced from the data.FindingsThe drawings
   place the researcher within the interpretation and analysis and bridge
   the distance in three ways: one, by ``making sense{''} of or
   contextualising the data; two, by producing themes and three, by
   attending to emotions. This article demonstrates how the art medium of
   drawing deepens the interpretivistic intentions of qualitative research
   by offering a critical lens to the data and by embedding reflexivity
   into the analysis.Originality/valueThis article demonstrates how the

Title = {Viewpoint Selection for 3D Scenes in Map Narratives},
Journal = {ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {Narrative mapping, an advanced geographic information visualization
   technology, presents spatial information episodically, enhancing
   readers' spatial understanding and event cognition. However, during 3D
   scene construction, viewpoint selection is heavily reliant on the
   cartographer's subjective interpretation of the event. Even with
   fixed-angle settings, the task of ensuring that selected viewpoints
   align with the narrative theme remains challenging. To address this, an
   automated viewpoint selection method constrained by narrative relevance
   and visual information is proposed. Narrative relevance is determined by
   calculating spatial distances between each element and the thematic
   element within the scene. Visual information is quantified by assessing
   the visual salience of elements as the ratio of their projected area on
   the view window to their total area. Pearson's correlation coefficient
   is used to evaluate the relationship between visual salience and
   narrative relevance, serving as a constraint to construct a viewpoint
   fitness function that integrates the visual salience of the convex
   polyhedron enclosing the scene. The chaotic particle swarm optimization
   (CPSO) algorithm is utilized to locate the viewpoint position while
   maximizing the fitness function, identifying a viewpoint meeting
   narrative and visual salience requirements. Experimental results
   indicate that, compared to the maximum projected area method and
   fixed-value method, a higher viewpoint fitness is achieved by this
   approach. The narrative views generated by this method were positively
   recognized by approximately two-thirds of invited professionals. This
   process aligns effectively with narrative visualization needs, enhances
   3D narrative map creation efficiency, and offers a robust strategy for
   viewpoint selection in 3D scene-based narrative mapping.},

Abstract = {Data-driven storytelling has gained prominence in journalism and other
   data reporting fields. However, the process of creating these stories
   remains challenging, often requiring the integration of effective
   visualizations with compelling narratives to form a cohesive,
   interactive presentation. To help streamline this process, we present an
   integrated authoring framework and system, DataWeaver, that supports
   both visualization-to-text and text-to-visualization composition.
   DataWeaver enables users to create data narratives anchored to data
   facts derived from ``call-out{''} interactions, i.e., user-initiated
   highlights of visualization elements that prompt relevant narrative
   content. In addition to this ``vis-to-text{''} composition, DataWeaver
   also supports a ``text-initiated{''} approach, generating relevant
   interactive visualizations from existing narratives. Key findings from
   an evaluation with 13 participants highlighted the utility and usability
   of DataWeaver and the effectiveness of its integrated authoring
   framework. The evaluation also revealed opportunities to enhance the
   framework by refining filtering mechanisms and visualization
   recommendations and better support authoring creativity by introducing
   advanced customization options.},

Abstract = {Data video is an increasingly popular genre of narrative visualization.
   To distill a data story into a video, designers need to draft a sequence
   of data facts and visually connect them by animated transitions. Such
   animated transitions are critical for illustrating data changes and
   enhancing narrative coherence; however, their design still lacks
   systematic guidance. To fill this gap, we developed a design space by
   collecting and analyzing 89 high-quality data videos. The design space
   characterizes the design of animated transitions under three dimensions:
   narrative relation, data change, and transition animation. We conducted
   an online design workshop with 14 participants to evaluate the
   effectiveness of our design space on designing transitions. The results
   show that the design patterns summarized in our design space can be used
   to efficiently guide the transition designs in data videos.},

Abstract = {Sentiment and emotion analyses (SEA) provide us with the opportunity to
   gain objective and fast insights into the experiences of vast amounts of
   individuals. Despite SEA's efficiency, two main limitations associated
   with its use remain: outcome aggregation and narrow applicability.
   Outcome aggregation means that outputs do not consider participants'
   attributes nor allow for individual analyses of participants'
   experiences and/or the degree to which these experiences may express
   consistent or contradictory emotions (i.e., emotional entropy). Narrow
   applicability means that SEA has primarily been employed in market
   research to understand customers' satisfaction thus foregoing its
   applicability in qualitative and mixed methods academic research. With
   these opportunities and limitations in mind, our study was designed to
   offer an analytic framework that avoids outcome aggregation and expands
   the use of SEA beyond market research. As part of our study's
   contribution, we offer a free to use and free to distribute software
   tool that implements the totality of our proposed analytic framework.
   This software does not require any programming proficiency and executes
   all required back-end processes locally-thus avoiding the need to upload
   our data to any servers. In our proposed framework, outcome aggregation
   is avoided via network modeling that also enables testing for potential
   differences in emotions distributions across groups. Based on this
   integration, we refer to the resulting analytic framework and software
   as Sentiment and Emotion Network Analysis-SENA. As part of our
   methodological and research design discussion, we also illustrate how to
   integrate SENA with machine learning text classification of documents or
   open-ended responses. This integration serves to leverage the power of
   artificial intelligence in studies relying on SENA. The databases used
   to showcase this analytic framework are provided so that researchers may
   interact firsthand with the SENA framework and its externally
   peer-reviewed software (https://cutt.ly/BrhEnyfY) available in Mac

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Visual learning analytics (VLA) is becoming increasingly adopted in
   educational technologies and learning analytics dashboards to convey
   critical insights to students and educators. Yet many students
   experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their
   limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding
   approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing
   students' comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to
   scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI)
   technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential
   solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance
   students' comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates
   the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with
   scaffolding techniques, in improving students' comprehension of VLA. A
   randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education
   students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive
   agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which
   utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA
   comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield
   comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after
   the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance
   students' VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and
   standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the
   intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with
   scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students' comprehension
   skills and support genuine learning.},

Abstract = {Data-driven storytelling has grown significantly, becoming prevalent in
   various fields, including healthcare. In medical narratives, characters
   are crucial for engaging audiences, making complex medical information
   accessible, and potentially influencing positive behavioral and
   lifestyle changes. However, designing characters that are both
   educational and relatable to effectively engage audiences is
   challenging. We propose a GenAI-assisted pipeline for character design
   in data-driven medical stories, utilizing Stable Diffusion, a deep
   learning text-to-image model, to transform data into visual character
   representations. This approach reduces the time and artistic skills
   required to create characters that reflect the underlying data. As a
   proof-of-concept, we generated and evaluated two characters in a
   crowd-sourced case study, assessing their authenticity to the underlying
   data and consistency over time. In a qualitative evaluation with four
   experts with knowledge in design and health communication, the
   characters were discussed regarding their quality and refinement
   opportunities. The characters effectively conveyed various aspects of
   the data, such as emotions, age, and body weight. However, generating
   multiple consistent images of the same character proved to be a
   significant challenge. This underscores a key issue in using generative
   AI for character creation: the limited control designers have over the

Abstract = {As part of the project Forest Carbon Futures, I present reflections from
   a communitybased initiative to co-design public resources for data
   understanding, engagement, and advocacy at the intersection of forest
   and climate research and policy. This work leverages critical, creative
   approaches, strategies and insights from visual communication design,
   narrative visualisation, and related practices to express complex forest
   carbon data in ways that preserve ecological specificity while
   supporting meaningful connections between diverse publics, data
   representations, more-than-human communities, and real-world
   implications and possibilities. Through a lens of storytelling and
   ecological situatedness, we seek to re-frame extractive narratives that
   homogenise and decontextualise the forest, and foster visual
   sense-making practices that convey a visceral sense of place alongside
   the complex, mycelial role of forest carbon in our lives. Here I discuss
   initial insights from our co-design process in order to inform future
   work surrounding ecological and climate data literacies, focusing
   particularly on avenues for invoking ecological place and narrative in
   fostering community-organising, policy-making, and advocacy.},

Abstract = {Biography digital storytelling is a narrative method rooted in
   reconstruction and deduction, designed to achieve the associative,
   semantic, situational, and visual representation of biographical
   content. Drawing from narratology theory, this research explores an
   ontology-based implementation pathway for biography digital storytelling
   through four key stages: selection and characteristics analysis of
   storytelling materials, extraction and semantic association of
   storytelling elements via ontology, clustering biographical themes and
   connecting narrative threads using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),
   and visualizing the biography through structured storylines. The study
   aims to deepen the mining of biographical knowledge, enable creative
   interpretation of storytelling content, and more effectively convey the
   biographical subject's spirit, offering both an innovative technical
   approach and theoretical perspectives on biography digital storytelling.},

Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly popular for organizing and
   managing knowledge across various industries and academic fields.
   Knowledge graphs assist users to better understand domain knowledge by
   reorganizing and aggregating information. In the application scenario,
   recent research has mainly focused on constructing knowledge graphs to
   create narrative visualizations from the perspective of humanities
   expert, but the mapping relationship between knowledge graphs and
   narrative scripts which visualization designers specialize in remains
   largely unexplored. This paper aims to explore the use of cultural
   heritage knowledge graphs for producing narrative scripts that
   creatively preserve and communicate cultural heritage. To achieve this,
   the researchers constructed an ethnic costumes knowledge graph based on
   data collected from the Chinese National Museums of Ethnology and a
   literature survey. We conducted an experiment to identify typical
   patterns in data exploration and narrative scripts that linked to the
   designers' authorial intent and process. Based on our analysis, we
   present design recommendations for narrative visualization with
   knowledge graphs that could provide practical guidance in designing
   cultural heritage information visualization.},

Abstract = {PurposeTraumatic Brain Injury (TBI) can result in reduced social
   participation due to changes in cognition and communication. This study
   explored Instagram \#TraumaticBrainInjury posts to determine how the
   platform was being used by people with brain injury and how TBI was
   discussed.Materials and methodsExploratory, qualitatively-driven,
   mixed-methods research design. Content analysis was conducted on the top
   100 \#TraumaticBrainInjury posts that met the study criteria. From each
   category identified in content analysis, two-three posts were further
   analysed using visual data analysis, then reflexive thematic analysis
   was used on this data to gain deeper understanding.ResultsContent
   analysis generated four categories: Promotional, Motivational,
   Educational, and Life Experiences. Thematic analysis of nine visual data
   narratives generated four themes: Sharing their Stories, Navigating
   Challenge, Anticipating More, and Building
   Community.ConclusionsCommunity groups and people with TBI facilitated
   social connections and exchange about symptoms, recovery, struggles, and
   day-to-day life. Organisations and health professionals used the
   platform to provide information and promote their services to people
   with TBI. However, health professionals are under-utilised Instagram to
   promote social interactions and advocacy. The overall sentiment of the
   \#TraumaticBrainInjury community was supportive and positive, suggesting
   integration of the platform into TBI rehabilitation would be beneficial
   for targeting social isolation.},

Abstract = {Narrative visualization integrates data visualization and narrative

   notoriously difficult to evaluate. One solution is heuristic evaluation,
   using a domain-specific set of heuristics. This paper validates a set of

   We conducted studies with experienced narrative visualization
   practitioners in both summative and formative settings. We found that
   the set of heuristics showed promise in a summative setting, where
   similar responses evidenced that the set of heuristics could provide
   reliable evaluation metrics. Furthermore, in a formative setting,
   implementing the set of heuristics was reported to be useful in the
   design process; however, due to their limited focus, we recommend that
   it be implemented in conjunction with other evaluation guidelines.},

   Storytelling},
Journal = {INFORMATION POLITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-81},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The open government data (OGD) movement claims to contribute to
   transparency and increased citizen understanding of government action.
   However, the literature so far shows these goals are not being reached,
   as `common' (non-expert) citizens fail to access and understand OGD.
   This research makes an empirical contribution to this debate through a
   design experiment in the form of a field lab with a governmental agency,
   data visualization experts, and non-expert citizens in the Netherlands.
   In this field lab, the current practice of disseminating OGD by a
   regional water authority on the issue of drought was redesigned based on
   non-expert citizens' needs. Our findings show that non-expert citizens
   prefer data storytelling techniques over OGD portals or traditional OGD
   visualizations such as graphs or dashboards. This is informative for the
   current shift from OGD geared at expert users, to OGD geared at
   fostering effective transparency with non-expert users. We also build on
   existing research to develop new evaluation criteria for OGD
   visualizations, and find that completeness and usability seem more
   important than objectivity in disseminating OGD with non-expert citizens
   when communicating about complex policy problems.},

Abstract = {This study employed qualitative content analysis to explore data-driven
   journalistic practices employed by mainstream and citizen journalists on
   X (formerly known as Twitter) and how these practices foster civic
   engagement among Ghanaian X users. The study was grounded in the
   materiality, performativity, and reflexivity framework of data
   journalism and the civic engagement model. The findings were that the
   main themes of data-driven narratives on X were politics, socioeconomic
   discourse, and particularly economic metrics. Materiality and
   performativity showed up in the human agency of journalists and in the
   skills and expertise of those who contextualise and interpret the data.
   Data journalists liaise with allied data production specialists to
   convert raw data into data artifacts to tell stories. Ghanaian X users
   actively used the offered data stories to participate in civic arguments
   and discussions on social media. They back data stories with personal
   anecdotes. Through the proactive deployment of surveys, the creation of
   X polls, and other cooperative efforts, the examined narratives
   illustrated the performativity of data journalism as a technique that
   subverts power structures. The study provides evidence for the important
   role of peripheral actors in data journalism and how their efforts drive
   civic discourse to potentially drive tangible societal transformations.},

Title = {Developing Novel Tools for Bioethics Education: ACECS and the Visual
   Analytics Dashboard},
Journal = {CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY OF HEALTHCARE ETHICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 6},
Abstract = {The translation of bedside experience to pedagogical content presents a
   unique challenge for the field of bioethics. The contributions are
   multidisciplinary, the practices are heterogeneous, and the work product
   is characteristically nuanced. While academic bioethics education
   programs have proliferated, developing content and pedagogy sufficient
   to teach clinical ethics effectively remains a longstanding challenge.
   The authors identify three reasons why progress towards this goal has
   been slow. First, there is a lack of robust, empirical knowledge for
   education focused on praxis. Second, the methods employed in academic
   education tend to focus on traditional didactic approaches rather than
   engendering competency through interaction and practice-the principle
   means by which clinical ethicists work. Third, the data practitioners
   have captured has not been presented in a medium educators and students
   can most meaningfully interact with.In this paper, the authors describe
   a novel pedagogical tool: the Armstrong Clinical Ethics Coding System
   (ACECS) and interactive visual analytics dashboard. Together, these
   components comprise an educational platform that utilizes the empirical
   data collected by the institution's ethics service. The tool offers four
   advantages. First, it aids with the identification of ethical issues
   that present during a consultation at that specific institution or
   medical unit by making use of a lingua franca comprehensible to both
   ethicists and non-ethicists. Second, content is centered on issue
   frequency, type, and relation to other issues. Iterating through cases,
   requestors, or hospital units allows one to understand cases
   typologically and through metanarratives that reveal relationships and
   subtle patterns. Third, the use of interactive data visualizations and
   data storytelling aids comprehension and retention. Fourth, the process
   of using the system necessitates understanding the manifold ways each
   case can be understood, accommodating a wide range of perspectives and
   ethical lenses, enhancing case analysis and self-reflection conducive to
   life-long learning.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Our life stories evolve in specific and contextualized places. Although
   our households may be our primarily shaping environment, our
   neighborhoods expose us to the immediate ``real world{''} outside home.
   Indeed, the places where we are currently experiencing and have
   experienced life play fundamental roles in the development of our
   identities, beliefs, fears, perceptions of the world, and even in the
   (mis)understanding of our prospects of social mobility. Despite the
   analytic benefits that knowledge of the places and contexts where we
   experience life brings to better understanding our life stories and
   health outcomes, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods researchers
   continue to forego the analytic and elucidating power that
   geo-contextualizing our participants' narratives bring to our analyses,
   research findings, conclusions, and plans of action. From this view
   then, most qualitative, health, and mixed methods research findings and
   conclusions may have been ignoring the spatial contexts that most likely
   have shaped the experiences of research participants. The main reason
   for the underuse of these geo-contextualized stories is the requirement
   of specialized training in geographical information systems (GIS) and/or
   computer and statistical programming along with the absence of cost-free
   and user-friendly geo-visualization tools that may allow non-GIS experts
   to benefit from geo-contextualized outputs. To address this gap, we
   present GeoStoryTelling, an analytic framework and user-friendly,
   cost-free, multi-platform software that enables researchers to visualize
   their geo-contextualized qualitative narratives. The use of this
   peer-reviewed software (see https://doi.org/10.24433/CO.7385885.v3),
   available in Mac (https://cutt.ly/E724wAx) and Windows
   (https://cutt.ly/J724f0C) operating systems, does not require users to
   learn GIS nor computer/statistical programming to obtain
   state-of-the-art, and visually appealing and interactive maps. These
   resulting HTML visualizations are capable of integrating a variety of
   multi-media inputs that include text, image, videos, sound
   recordings/music, as well as hyperlinks to other websites-see
   https://cutt.ly/k7X9tfN. Since GeoStoryTelling relies on OpenStreetMap,
   its applications may be used worldwide, thus strengthening its potential
   reach to the qualitative, mixed methods, ethnographic, and health
   scientific communities, regardless of location around the world.},

Abstract = {Datafication is reshaping feminism, as feminist pioneers, groups and
   communities increasingly engage with data practices for advocacy,
   activism and social change. This is a netnographic study exploring how
   feminist actors in China appropriate the emerging technology of
   datafication to develop grassroots narratives for pursuing gender
   justice, focussing on two pioneering feminist collectives as key
   studies. The study begins by reviewing the role of gender data in
   women's empowerment within China's socio-political context, followed by
   an outline of the feminist data narrative concepts that combine
   Couldry's theory of data as narrative with insights from data feminism.
   Using these two cases, it illustrates how and why these collectives
   engage in data feminism to foreground gender justice. These examples
   demonstrate the ways in which data narratives offer transformative and
   empowering potential, generating new epistemic imaginaries of feminism
   in China. Ultimately, this paper underscores a paradigm shift towards
   the datafication of feminist narratives, connecting the contextual realm
   to the relational dynamics of data science for her social good.},

Abstract = {Documentaries and data visualizations have long sought innovative
   approaches to narrate data-driven stories, striving to balance effective
   storytelling and insightful data visualization. Despite the growing
   interest in this intersection, limited research has been published on
   the convergence of these two domains. This article aims to bridge this
   gap, offering a preliminary exploration into their points of
   convergence. Our study centers on data-driven webdocs -a novel form of
   web documentary that places data visualization at its core while
   incorporating other multimedia elements to enrich the narrative
   experience. In this paper, we compile existing research and analyze
   specific examples to identify the distinctive features of data-driven
   webdocs. Furthermore, building upon prior studies, we propose that this
   emerging format be recognized as a new genre for narrating stories

Abstract = {ObjectiveThe present conflict in Israel has led to a surge in cases of
   acute stress disorder (ASD). The study examined a training program for
   integrative medicine (IM) providers working in supportive and palliative
   care settings, teaching clinical skills for treating ASD.MethodsA 10-h
   online training program, designed by supportive care trained IM and
   mental health professionals was attended by a group of 32 IM providers.
   The impact of the course was assessed using pre- and post-training
   questionnaires, which underwent qualitative evaluation. Three open-ended
   questions addressed expectations from the program, anticipated barriers
   to combining IM with mental health interventions, and explored
   willingness for multi-disciplinary collaboration. A conventional content
   analysis was used, where coding categories are derived directly from the
   text data. Narratives were analyzed using ATLAS.ti software for
   systematic coding.ResultsNarrative themes identified within the group of
   32 trainees included expectations regarding facilitating a
   multi-disciplinary integrative model of care, enriching the ASD-related
   clinical ``toolbox,{''} increasing the effectiveness of IM treatments,
   and reducing IM treatment-associated risks. Insights were provided for
   bridging communication gaps between IM practitioners and mental health
   providers, supporting the multi-disciplinary
   collaboration.ConclusionsASD-focused training for IM practitioners may
   increase their level of clinical skills and advance collaboration with
   mental health providers. Future research examining the feasibility of
   the integrative model and its implementation in supportive care setting
   is warranted.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2025},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {As universities grapple with contentious socio-political climates,
   promoting intergroup relations efforts remains critical in mitigating
   these conflicts. Intergroup dialogue (IGD) provides one approach to
   improving intergroup relations in higher education. Prior evidence
   suggests that IGD reduces prejudice, increases empathy, builds critical
   consciousness, and improves intergroup relations. However, scant studies
   document virtual and multi-site IGD, especially those that include
   varied stakeholders. The current study sought to close these gaps by
   offering a facilitated and sustained four-stage model of IGD that
   concluded with collaborative action projects. A total of 32 students,
   faculty, and staff from eight universities in California participated in
   a virtual 20-hour, two-semester IGD program aimed to (1) generate
   dialogue around systemic barriers to graduation and (2) create action
   projects that address equity issues. Pre- and post-surveys with 22
   participants showed increased intergroup empathy, improved comfort in
   having difficult conversations, and increased interest in future action
   behaviors. The participants also developed 10 action projects aimed at
   closing equity gaps through data storytelling, resource dissemination,
   dialogue programming, and policy advocacy. Our study adds to the
   effectiveness of IGD in higher education, offers important lessons
   learned, and highlights the implications of this work for both IGD
   practitioners and universities.},

Abstract = {Onboarding a user to a visualization dashboard entails explaining its
   various components, including the chart types used, the data loaded, and
   the interactions available. Authoring such an onboarding experience is
   time-consuming and requires significant knowledge and little guidance on
   how best to complete this task. Depending on their levels of expertise,
   end users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and
   overwhelmed or disinterested and disengaged. We propose interactive
   dashboard tours (D-Tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences that
   preserve the agency of users with various levels of expertise to keep
   them interested and engaged. Our interactive tours concept draws from
   open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path
   through onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called
   D-TOUR PROTOTYPE, which allows authors to craft custom interactive
   dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically
   generated tours can still be customized to use different media (e.g.,
   video, audio, and highlighting) or new narratives to produce an
   onboarding experience tailored to an individual user. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert
   interviews. Our evaluation shows that authors found the automation in
   the D-Tour Prototype helpful and time-saving, and users found the
   created tours engaging and intuitive. This paper and all supplemental

Title = {Investigating the Effect of Visualization Literacy and Guidance on
   Teachers' Dashboard Interpretation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on
   designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization
   guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or
   narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or
   trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting
   visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students'
   learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers
   interpret students' data through these dashboards, many have overlooked
   the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly
   impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy
   (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret
   dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account
   exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual
   representations of students' data. In this paper, we address this gap by
   investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and
   without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We
   illustrate this by analyzing teachers' think-aloud sessions as they
   engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online
   learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs.
   Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in
   interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings
   revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard
   interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL
   with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also,
   visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their
   interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to
   complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be
   detrimental.},

Abstract = {Annotations play a vital role in highlighting critical aspects of
   visualizations, aiding in data externalization and exploration,
   collaborative sensemaking, and visual storytelling. However, despite
   their widespread use, we identified a lack of a design space for common
   practices for annotations. In this paper, we evaluated over 1,800 static
   annotated charts to understand how people annotate visualizations in
   practice. Through qualitative coding of these diverse real-world
   annotated charts, we explored three primary aspects of annotation usage
   patterns: analytic purposes for chart annotations (e.g., present,
   identify, summarize, or compare data features), mechanisms for chart
   annotations (e.g., types and combinations of annotations used, frequency
   of different annotation types across chart types, etc.), and the data
   source used to generate the annotations. We then synthesized our
   findings into a design space of annotations, highlighting key design
   choices for chart annotations. We presented three case studies
   illustrating our design space as a practical framework for chart
   annotations to enhance the communication of visualization insights. All

Abstract = {Written language is a useful tool for non-visual creative activities
   like composing essays and planning searches. This paper investigates the
   integration of written language into the visualization design process.
   We create the idea of a `writing rudder,' which acts as a guiding force
   or strategy for the designer. Via an interview study of 24 working
   visualization designers, we first established that only a minority of
   participants systematically use writing to aid in design. A second study
   with 15 visualization designers examined four different variants of
   written rudders: asking questions, stating conclusions, composing a
   narrative, and writing titles. Overall, participants had a positive
   reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down
   components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach
   in future design work. More specifically, two approaches - writing
   questions and writing conclusions/takeaways - were seen as beneficial
   across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise
   mainly for the creation stage. Although concerns around potential bias
   during data exploration were raised, participants also discussed
   strategies to mitigate such concerns. This paper contributes to a deeper
   understanding of the interplay between language and visualization, and
   proposes a straightforward, lightweight addition to the visualization
   design process.},

   visualization atlases and semi-structured interviews with eight
   visualization atlas creators. Based on our results, we contribute (1) a
   definition of a visualization atlas as a compendium of (web) pages aimed
   at explaining and supporting exploration of data about a dedicated topic
   through data, visualizations and narration. (2) a set of design patterns
   of 8 design dimensions, (3) insights into the atlas creation from
   interviews and (4) the definition of 5 visualization atlas genres. We
   found that visualization atlases are unique in the way they combine i)
   exploratory visualization, ii) narrative elements from data-driven
   storytelling and iii) structured navigation mechanisms. They target a
   wide range of audiences with different levels of domain knowledge,
   acting as tools for study, communication, and discovery. We conclude
   with a discussion of current design practices and emerging questions

Abstract = {Data videos increasingly becoming a popular data storytelling form
   represented by visual and audio integration. In recent years, more and
   more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective
   and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides
   a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been
   adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about
   applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little
   systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a
   specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to
   manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this
   gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey
   as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we
   examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data
   videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages,
   sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey
   structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide
   practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for
   different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure,
   Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our
   proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants
   were invited to design data videos with and without our design space
   guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our
   design space provides useful and practical guidance for data
   storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey.},

Abstract = {Communicating insights from data effectively requires design skills,
   technical knowledge, and experience. Data must be accurately represented
   with aesthetically pleasing visuals and engaging text to effectively
   communicate to the intended audience. Data storytelling has received
   much attention lately, but as of yet, it does not have a theoretical and
   practical foundation in information science. A data story adds context,
   narrative, and structure to the visual representation of data, providing
   audiences with character, plot, and a holistic experience of narrative.
   This paper proposes a methodological approach to transform a data
   visualization into a data story based on the
   Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) pyramid and the S-DIKW
   Framework. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid, the proposed
   approach defines a strategy to represent insights extracted from data.
   Data is then turned into information by identifying character(s) facing
   a problem, adding textual and graphic content; information is turned
   into knowledge by organizing what happens as a plot. Finally, a call to
   wise action-always informed by cultural and community values-completes
   the storytelling transformation to create a data story. This article
   contributes to the theoretical understanding of data stories as emerging
   information forms, supporting richer understandings of a story as
   information in the information sciences.},

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Augmented video presentation tools provide a natural way for presenters
   to interact with their content, resulting in engaging experiences for
   remote audiences, such as when a presenter uses hand gestures to
   manipulate and direct attention to visual aids overlaid on their webcam
   feed. However, authoring and customizing these presentations can be
   challenging, particularly when presenting dynamic data visualization
   (i.e., animated charts). To this end, we introduce VisConductor, an
   authoring and presentation tool that equips presenters with the ability
   to configure gestures that control affect-varying visualization
   animation, foreshadow visualization transitions, direct attention to
   notable data points, and animate the disclosure of annotations. These
   gestures are integrated into configurable widgets, allowing presenters
   to trigger content transformations by executing gestures within widget
   boundaries, with feedback visible only to them. Altogether, our palette
   of widgets provides a level of flexibility appropriate for
   improvisational presentations and ad-hoc content transformations, such
   as when responding to audience engagement. To evaluate VisConductor, we
   conducted two studies focusing on presenters (N = 11) and audience
   members (N = 11). Our findings indicate that our approach taken with
   VisConductor can facilitate interactive and engaging remote
   presentations with dynamic visual aids. Reflecting on our findings, we
   also offer insights to inform the future of augmented video presentation
   tools.},

   multi-component. Additionally, these genres were classified, considering
   not only this structure but also visual representation, interaction
   techniques, freedom of exploration, and narrative approach. Finally, we
   conducted a workshop with professionals experienced in data

Abstract = {Effective narrative visualization communicates information by
   integrating story-telling and data visualization in a comprehensible,

   narrative visualization can best be designed to influence target
   audiences. This paper focuses on an empirical experiment where we
   examined the effects of two communication strategies-anthropomorphism
   and personal identification-on a young adult audience. In particular, we
   wanted to understand which strategy, when integrated into narrative
   visualization, can nudge a specific audience's attitude towards greater
   consideration in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results
   indicated that the personal identification communication strategy was
   the most successful in nudging participants. This study contributes a
   better grasp of how technologies such as narrative visualization, using

Abstract = {Data stories are sequences of data facts connected through a meaningful
   narrative and combine data visualizations and storytelling to convey
   information effectively. They have gained popularity due to data
   journalism, evolving into a hybrid practice involving computer science,
   design, and storytelling. Creating data stories requires diverse skills
   however there is a lack of guidance. We found one model that identifies
   the process of transforming data into visual stories following three
   stages; explore data, make a story and tell a story. Based on this
   approach, we surveyed recent literature on data stories in order to
   classify their contributions to each of the three stages. The
   contribution of this review is the proposal of guidelines for authors
   that provide greater detail to each stage and gaps for future research.
   We hope that by better understanding the design process and the
   guidelines that emerge from it, we will enrich the quality of the data
   stories and thus make them more meaningful and engaging to readers.},

Title = {Integrating Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility into a Data
   Storytelling Model for Health Informatics Education},

Abstract = {Background Health informatics education is pivotal in integrating
   diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) principles into
   curricula and leveraging data with equity considerations. Integrating
   clinically driven data with other datasets is crucial to comprehensive
   understanding of patient care demographics, experiences, and outcomes to
   create equity-minded data storytelling. Publicly available Healthy
   People 2030 (HP2030) resources complement academic electronic health
   records, supporting tailored learning activities in informatics
   education to enhance educational utility through a DEIA lens. Objectives
   This case report describes the expansion of an existing diversity,
   equity, and inclusion (DEI) checklist to an updated DEIA checklist for
   preparing future informaticians to collect and critically evaluate DEIA
   features using this checklist in creating equity-minded data
   storytelling. Methods The DEI-Oriented Data Storytelling Model and the
   HP2030 framework were utilized to develop the DEIA checklist. We
   employed an informal cognitive walkthrough to expand the DEIA checklist
   and evaluate the DEIA measures or characteristics within datasets from
   the HP2030 social determinants of health (SDOH) five topics using this
   checklist. Results We reviewed 76 available SDOH-related datasets and
   added six measures to ``demographics{''} and seven to ``skills,
   abilities, and accessibility{''} of the DEIA checklist. Our evaluation
   of the DEIA checklist verified HP2030's inclusion of all measures,
   except ``religions/beliefs.{''} All DEIA measures were linked to equity
   and accessibility, one in inclusion, and the inclusion of three
   characteristics comprising the category ``language{''} and six
   characteristics comprising the category ``images.{''} Conclusion Results
   highlighted the accessibility and comprehensiveness of HP2030
   demographic data resources, considering SDOH factors and promoting
   inclusive data representation to address health disparities. The DEIA
   checklist provides a structured tool in facilitating unbiased data
   collection and visualization of SDOH-related data through an
   equity-informed lens. Integrating an equity-minded data storytelling
   with frameworks like HP2030 enriches health informatics education,
   broadens students' understanding of health disparities, and supports
   evidence-based interventions for improved health outcomes.},

Title = {A mixed methods analysis of a yearlong intercultural competence
   curriculum strand},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 10},
Abstract = {Background: In a published 2016 report, it was estimated that
   approximately 80\% of public-school teachers identified as White (United
   States Department of Education 2016). The duality of the issue is that
   the diversity of the teacher workforce has improved since 1990 but lags
   in comparison to the increasing diversity of the student population
   {[}Gumber, C., and J. Beckhusen. 2022. ``U.S. Teachers More Diverse but
   Still Lag Student Racial, Ethnic Makeup{''}. United States Census
   Bureau, January 5. Accessed August 12, 2022.
   https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/01/nations-teachers-more-div
   erse-but-still-lag-racial-ethnic-makeup-of-students.html.]. The
   discrepancy that exists in racial or ethnic diversity between teachers
   and students has been termed a cultural gap {[}Muschell, L. H., and H.
   M. Roberts. 2011. ``Bridging the Cultural Gap: One Teacher Education
   Program's Response to Preparing Culturally Responsive Teachers.{''}
   Childhood Education 87 (5): 337-340.
   https://doi.org/10.1080/00094056.2011.10523209]. The value proposition
   for a teacher workforce that mirrors society is hard to dispute. In the
   broadest sense, members of the education sector must coordinate efforts
   to recruit and retain culturally diverse teachers. While these efforts
   are critical, progress will likely be carried out over a longer period
   of time. Thus, adequately preparing current and future teachers to
   bridge the cultural gap is essential.Purpose: Intercultural competence
   (ICC) is an increasingly relevant topic for teacher preparation
   programs. To date, there remains a relative dearth of research on
   strategies that physical education teacher education (PETE) programs can
   use to promote ICC among teacher candidates (TCs). This study aimed to
   explore a yearlong curriculum strand's impact on promoting ICC
   development in TCs.Methods: A mixed methods research design involving
   quantitative and qualitative data collection was employed. The
   quantitative measure was the Intercultural Development Inventory (R).
   Qualitative measures consisted of journal entries and semi-structured
   interviews. Datasets were then merged to generate mixed-data narratives.
   Participants included 29 TCs enrolled at a mid-Atlantic
   University.Findings: Analyses revealed that the curriculum strand did
   not promote significant change in teacher candidates' ICC levels
   quantitatively. Researchers used the constant comparison method to
   interpret the mixed data narratives. Analyses of the mixed data
   narratives revealed four emergent themes: (a) experience with cultural
   diversity; (b) confidence to teach culturally diverse students; (c)
   making sense of ICC; and (d) reflection on action.Conclusions:
   Participant data suggests that ICC is a topic that TCs value but may be
   lacking in their practical, applied understanding of working across
   cultural differences. Implications and future research on promoting ICC
   among physical education TCs are discussed. To our knowledge, this study
   will be the first application of the IDI (R) to explore change following
   physical education TCs' participation in a yearlong curriculum strand
   focused on promoting ICC.},

   to address this challenge, in particular through interactive data
   comics. We developed an interactive data comic that communicates cancer
   data. A between-group study with 98 participants was carried out to
   evaluate the data comic's ease of understanding and engagement, compared
   to a text medium that captures the same information. The study reveals
   that the data comic is perceived to be more engaging, and participants
   have greater recall and understanding of the data within the story,

Abstract = {In recent years, narrative visualization has gained much attention.
   Researchers have proposed different design spaces for various narrative
   visualization genres and scenarios to facilitate the creation process.
   As users' needs grow and automation technologies advance, increasingly

   summarized six genres of narrative visualization (annotated charts,
   infographics, timelines \& storylines, data comics, scrollytelling \&
   slideshow, and data videos) based on previous research and four types of
   tools (design spaces, authoring tools, ML/AI-supported tools and
   ML/AI-generator tools) based on the intelligence and automation level of
   the tools. We surveyed 105 papers and tools to study how automation can
   progressively engage in visualization design and narrative processes to
   help users easily create narrative visualizations. This research aims to
   provide an overview of current research and development in the
   automation involvement of narrative visualization tools. We discuss key

Abstract = {Data visualization and journalism are deeply connected. From early
   infographics to recent data-driven storytelling, visualization has
   become an integrated part of contemporary journalism, primarily as a
   communication artifact to inform the general public. Data journalism,
   harnessing the power of data visualization, has emerged as a bridge
   between the growing volume of data and our society. Visualization
   research that centers around data storytelling has sought to understand
   and facilitate such journalistic endeavors. However, a recent
   metamorphosis in journalism has brought broader challenges and
   opportunities that extend beyond mere communication of data. We present
   this article to enhance our understanding of such transformations and
   thus broaden visualization research's scope and practical contribution
   to this evolving field. We first survey recent significant shifts,
   emerging challenges, and computational practices in journalism. We then
   summarize six roles of computing in journalism and their implications.
   Based on these implications, we provide propositions for visualization
   research concerning each role. Ultimately, by mapping the roles and
   propositions onto a proposed ecological model and contextualizing
   existing visualization research, we surface seven general topics and a
   series of research agendas that can guide future visualization research
   at this intersection.},

Abstract = {As online news increasingly include data journalism, there is a
   corresponding increase in the incorporation of visualization in article
   thumbnail images. However, little research exists on the design
   rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping,
   simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the
   associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these
   design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail
   inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization
   thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail
   practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on
   the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for
   visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of
   visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study
   results indicate that different chart components play different roles in
   attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of
   the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design
   strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a
   data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with
   text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails.
   Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow
   effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles.
   Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured
   guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories.},

Abstract = {The design of visual narrative products and the expression of visual
   representations in videos are typically carried out independently,
   resulting in a lack of unified logic and systematic organization in
   multi-dimensional, multi-scale and multi-scenario narrative maps. To
   address this issue, this research project applies the concept of
   conceptual story model to the design of narrative map products and uses
   the hand-rolled map as a carrier to design an interactive narrative
   system. It utilizes a three-level model based on emotional design theory
   to design narrative videos and employs narrative theory to organize the
   storyline of the Nanjing Ming City Wall (NMCW). The experimental and
   statistical results show that the proposed method effectively represents
   the historical and cultural characteristics of the NMCW, aiding
   participants' understanding and supporting public dissemination of
   historical knowledge. It contributes to the multidimensional

Abstract = {Vision provides rapid processing for some tasks, but encounters strong
   constraints from others. Although many tasks encounter a capacity limit
   of processing four visual objects at once, some evidence suggests far
   lower limits for processing relationships among objects. What is our
   capacity limit for relational processing? If it is indeed limited, then
   people may miss important relationships between data values in a graph.
   To test this question, we asked people to explore graphs of trivially
   simple 2 x 2 data sets and found that half of the viewers missed
   surprising and improbable relationships (e.g., a child's height
   decreasing over time). These relationships were spotted easily in a
   control condition, which implicitly directed viewers to prioritize
   inspecting the key relationships. Thus, a severe limit on relational
   processing, combined with a cascade of other capacity-limited operations
   (e.g., linking values to semantic content), makes understanding a graph
   more like slowly reading a paragraph then immediately recognizing an
   image. These results also highlight the practical importance of ``data
   storytelling{''} techniques, where communicators design graphs that help
   their audience prioritize the most important relationships in data.},

Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Research output from inter- and trans-disciplinary research projects is
   challenging to store, link, analyze, and communicate among stakeholders
   and researchers from other fields. Datasets, models, and methods are
   often non-interactive, hard to access and understand, and hidden in
   research articles with specific terminologies. Here, we present GRETA
   Analytics, an R Shiny application developed to communicate the output of
   the GRETA (GReen Energy Transition Actions) EU Horizon 2020 research
   project. The tool presents and visualizes data collected from
   qualitative case studies, an extensive multinational survey in 16 EU
   countries, their re-use in scenario predictions, and their framing for
   developing interactive transition pathways for individuals and
   communities. With a strong geospatial focus and a narrative design, the

Abstract = {As data journalism continues to rise, narrative visualization has
   emerged as an essential method for conveying information. To improve the
   user experience of narrative visualization projects for data journalism,
   this study introduces an innovative approach for narrative visualization
   design centered on user experience. Firstly, through an in-depth
   analysis of existing research, we constructed a comprehensive
   user-experience-based narrative visualization model, considering the
   designers' design process and the multiple levels of the user experience
   process. Then, through case analysis and user interviews, we identified
   the key elements that influence the user experience. Through the
   analysis of multiple cases, this study presents a practical narrative
   visualization design methodology comprising eight dimensions, aimed at
   enhancing user experience. The primary contribution of this research
   lies in the proposal of a practical narrative visualization model and
   the clear definition of key design elements, providing a comprehensive
   reference framework for designers and researchers to effectively
   optimize the user experience of narrative visualization. Moreover, our
   research findings unveil the inherent correlation between user
   experience and design elements, offering valuable insights for future
   research and practical applications.},

Title = {Vlogger, storyteller or character? Chronotopic identity shifts and
   multimodal resources in COVID-19 vlogs},
Journal = {DISCOURSE CONTEXT \& MEDIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {59},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vlogs, as one of the most popular digital genres for the construction of
   personal experience, are an important site for the study of digital
   storytelling. Although the narration of ongoing events is becoming
   increasingly common in vlogs, narration of past events is still present.
   As they incorporate both storytelling modes, vloggers also act as
   editors curating and commenting on their materials. Thus, vloggers are
   presented with the task of transitioning between different chronotopic
   identities as characters, storytellers, and vloggers in their
   narratives. Research has shown that vloggers are judged based on
   perceived authenticity and credibility, as well as their ability to
   involve viewers, therefore managing these self-presentations is complex
   in view of the above requirements which have to be met if vloggers want
   to attain greater popularity. Drawing on a corpus of 47 YouTube vlogs
   documenting vloggers' experiences of COVID-19, we analyze how vloggers
   transition between these chronotopic identities, and describe such
   transitions according to a dual system of categorization based on the
   chronotopes involved in the transitions and their function. We find that
   vloggers shift focus between their roles as vlogger, storyteller, and
   character through the use of multimodal resources such as captions,
   overlaid media, and camera movement, and in doing so, address the
   demands that they need to meet in order to gain followers by presenting
   themselves as competent, credible, and engaging content creators.},

Abstract = {Knowledge communication in cultural heritage and digital humanities
   currently faces two challenges, which this paper addresses: On the one
   hand, data-driven storytelling in these fields has mainly focused on
   human protagonists, while other essential entities (such as artworks and
   artifacts, institutions, or places) have been neglected. On the other
   hand, storytelling tools rarely support the larger chains of data
   practices, which are required to generate and shape the data and
   visualizations needed for such stories. This paper introduces the
   InTaVia platform, which has been developed to bridge these gaps. It
   supports the practices of data retrieval, creation, curation, analysis,
   and communication with coherent visualization support for multiple types
   of entities. We illustrate the added value of this open platform for
   storytelling with four case studies, focusing on (a) the life of
   Albrecht D \& uuml;rer (person biography), (b) the Saliera salt cellar
   by Benvenuto Cellini (object biography), (c) the artist community of
   Lake Tuusula (group biography), and (d) the history of the Hofburg
   building complex in Vienna (place biography). Numerous suggestions for
   future research arise from this undertaking.},

Abstract = {Extracting data insights and generating visual data stories from tabular
   data are critical parts of data analysis. However, most existing studies
   primarily focus on tabular data stored as flat tables, typically without
   leveraging the relations between cells in the headers of hierarchical
   tables. When properly used, rich table headers can enable the extraction
   of many additional data stories. To assist analysts in visual data
   storytelling, an approach is needed to organize these data insights
   efficiently. In this work, we propose CoInsight, a system to facilitate
   visual storytelling for hierarchical tables by connecting insights.
   CoInsight extracts data insights from hierarchical tables and builds
   insight relations according to the structure of table headers. It
   further visualizes related data insights using a nested graph with edge
   bundling. We evaluate the CoInsight system through a usage scenario and
   a user experiment. The results demonstrate the utility and usability of
   CoInsight for converting data insights in hierarchical tables into
   visual data stories.},

Abstract = {Introduction . This paper discusses how ultrarunners create, use, and
   share embodied information on Instagram. The research explores how
   embodied information is used beyond the run, asking how visual social
   media digital practices shape how information is created, used, and
   shared. Method . Immersive observation of the ultrarunning community on
   Instagram was used to explore the use of embodied information. Analysis
   . Ethnographic data was analysed as an iterative and reflexive process.
   Data collection, analysis, and writing are intertwined processes in the
   research design. Results . The visual affordances of Instagram allow
   embodied information to be created, used and shared. Six genres of
   information about ultrarunning, which incorporate embodied information
   using visual media, are identified. Embodied information relating to the
   key genres of ultrarunning is shared using on the run video, live
   broadcasts, photographs of kit and data infographics. Conclusion . The
   paper contributes to the body of knowledge about embodied information by
   providing insight into how visual social media affordances support the
   creation, use, and sharing of embodied information.},

Title = {Visualization as irritation: producing knowledge about medieval courts
   through uncertainty},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Visualizations are ubiquitous in data-driven research, serving as both
   tools for knowledge production and genuine means of knowledge
   communication. Despite criticisms targeting the alleged objectivity of
   visualizations in the digital humanities (DH) and reflections on how
   they may serve as representations of both scholarly perspective and
   uncertainty within the data analysis pipeline, there remains a notable
   scarcity of in-depth theoretical grounding for these assumptions in DH
   discussions. It is our understanding that only through theoretical
   foundations such as basic semiotic principles and perspectives on media
   modality one can fully assess the use and potential of visualizations
   for innovation in scholarly interpretation. We argue that visualizations
   have the capacity to ``productively irritate{''} existing scholarly
   knowledge in a given research field. This does not just mean that
   visualizations depict patterns in datasets that seem not in line with
   prior research and thus stimulate deeper examination. Complementarily,
   ``irritation{''} here consists of visualizations producing uncertainty
   about their own meaning-yet it is precisely this uncertainty in which
   the potential for greater insight lies. It stimulates questions about
   what is depicted and what is not. This turns out to be a valuable
   resource for scholarly interpretation, and one could argue that
   visualizing big data is particularly prolific in this sense, because due
   to their complexity researchers cannot interpret the data without visual
   representations. However, we argue that ``productive irritation{''} can
   also happen below the level of big data. We see this potential rooted in
   the genuinely semiotic and semantic properties of visual media, which
   studies in multimodality and specifically in the field of Bildlinguistik
   have carved out: a visualization's holistic overview of data patterns is
   juxtaposed to its semantic vagueness, which gives way to deep
   interpretations and multiple perspectives on that data. We elucidate
   this potential using examples from medieval English legal history.
   Visualizations of data relating to legal functions and social
   constellations of various people in court offer surprising insights that
   can lead to new knowledge through ``productive irritation.{''}},

Abstract = {PurposeData storytelling courses position students as agents in creating
   stories interpreted from data about a social problem or social justice
   issue. The purpose of this study is to explore two research questions:
   What themes characterized students' iterative development of data story
   topics? Looking back at six years of iterative feedback, what categories
   of data literacy pedagogy did instructors engage for these
   themes?.Design/methodology/approachThis project examines six years of
   data storytelling final projects using thematic analysis and three years
   of instructor feedback. Ten themes in final projects align with patterns
   in feedback. Reflections on pedagogical approaches to students' topic
   development suggest extending data literacy pedagogy categories -
   formal, personal and folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green,
   2020).FindingsData storytelling can develop students' abilities to move
   from being consumers to creators of data and interpretations. The
   specific topic of personal data exposure or risk has presented some
   challenges for data literacy instruction (Bowler et al., 2017). What
   ``personal{''} means in terms of data should be defined more broadly.
   Extending the data literacy pedagogy categories of formal, personal and
   folk (Pangrazio and Sefton-Green, 2020) could more effectively center
   social justice in data literacy instruction.Practical
   implicationsImplications for practice include positioning students as
   producers of data interpretation, such as role-playing data analysis or
   decision-making scenarios.Social implicationsData storytelling has the
   potential to address current challenges in data literacy pedagogy and in
   teaching critical data literacy.Originality/valueCourse descriptions
   provide a template for future data literacy pedagogy involving data
   storytelling, and findings suggest implications for expanding
   definitions and applications of personal and folk data literacies.},

Abstract = {We present V-Mail, a framework of cross-platform applications,
   interactive techniques, and communication protocols for improved
   multi-person correspondence about spatial 3D datasets. Inspired by the
   daily use of e-mail, V-Mail seeks to enable a similar style of rapid,
   multi-person communication accessible on any device; however, it aims to
   do this in the new context of spatial 3D communication, where limited
   access to 3D graphics hardware typically prevents such communication.
   The approach integrates visual data storytelling with data exploration,
   spatial annotations, and animated transitions. V-Mail ``data stories{''}
   are exported in a standard video file format to establish a common
   baseline level of access on (almost) any device. The V-Mail framework
   also includes a series of complementary client applications and plugins
   that enable different degrees of story co-authoring and data
   exploration, adjusted automatically to match the capabilities of various
   devices. A lightweight, phone-based V-Mail app makes it possible to
   annotate data by adding captions to the video. These spatial annotations
   are then immediately accessible to team members running high-end 3D
   graphics visualization systems that also include a V-Mail client,
   implemented as a plugin. Results and evaluation from applying V-Mail to
   assist communication within an interdisciplinary science team studying
   Antarctic ice sheets confirm the utility of the asynchronous,
   cross-platform collaborative framework while also highlighting some
   current limitations and opportunities for future work.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this study was to explore college students'
   perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and their thoughts
   on prevention measures. Design and methods: A qualitative descriptive
   design was used. The study adopted purposive sampling at two
   universities in northern Taiwan and one in central Taiwan. Twenty-six
   college students participated, and data saturation was reached. Content
   analysis was undertaken. Results: Four main themes emerged from the data
   narratives: 1) having very little knowledge of HPV infection, 2) being
   concerned about outcomes of HPV infection, 3) taking measures to protect
   oneself, and 4) expecting to have HPV prevention resources. Conclusions:
   The results indicated that college students needed a more complete
   understanding of HPV and prevention methods to protect themselves from
   infection. Schools were an ideal place to provide adequate information
   on HPV prevention. Practice implications: The study suggested providing
   HPV-related information through school health centers and government
   health departments to resolve common questions and misunderstandings
   about HPV infection. Healthcare professionals should have a complete
   understanding of HPV-related knowledge in order to provide detailed
   information to young people. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Effect of Designer- versus User-driven Network-monitoring Dashboard
   Design on User Flow Experience and Performance: The Role of Augmented
   Virtuality},
Journal = {INFORMATION \& MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {61},

Abstract = {A well -designed dashboard can effectively communicate critical
   information to network administrators and enable them to identify and
   solve network issues quickly. However, little is understood about how
   networkmonitoring dashboard designs impact user experience in an
   augmented virtuality (AV) environment. Our study proposes that a
   dashboard design showing variations in selected elements can impact the
   networkmonitoring flow experience of users by affecting their enjoyment,
   concentration, and control, which in turn can influence their
   performance in critical, complex, and time -sensitive environments. To
   investigate this phenomenon, we design and evaluate two narrative
   visualization user interfaces-a designer -driven (DD) design and a user
   -driven (UD) design-in the context of network -monitoring dashboards.
   Adding vivid and familiar realworld objects may enhance perceived
   realism; thus, we integrate AV with the two dashboard designs (i.e., DD
   and UD) and evaluate their effect on user flow experience and
   performance. Results suggest that the flow experience of users will lead
   to positive perceived performance. A nonlinear relationship between AV
   and dashboard design, and the UD design with a moderate AV level can
   improve user flow experience and performance compared with the DD
   design. When the AV level is nonexistent or excessive, the superior
   effect of the UD design disappears. Lastly, we discuss practical
   implications and theoretical contributions, along with future research
   directions.},

   donations would not make a difference. In addition, they felt (2) a
   general lack of trust toward NPOs regarding financial stewardship.
   Finally, (3) they wanted organizations to develop data-driven narratives
   to share how funds were used to help the community. As such, the
   analysis and recommendations are rooted in Narrative Theory. Narrative

Abstract = {Data journalism is increasingly vital in our data-driven society,
   requiring professionals to gather, analyze, and visualize data for
   public understanding. While scholars recognize its significance, the
   audience-centric aspects remain underexplored. This study focuses on
   Eco-Nai+, a digital geo-journalism platform aiming to be Nigeria's
   first. It provides interactive data access via web and mobile apps and
   tools for geospatial data handling. Employing a multi-method approach,
   including document analysis, interviews, and platform analysis, this
   study examines how geo-data enhances data-driven storytelling, fosters
   cooperation and co-creation in data collection, and creates a new income
   stream for news organizations. From a business standpoint, Eco-Nai +
   functions as a ``newstech{''} company, capitalizing on digital age
   challenges. It offers journalists a means to inform and engage the
   public and policymakers in vital environmental discussions, especially
   in environments with limited open data sources. Crowdsourcing data is
   critical in this context, where open data and freedom of information
   legislation are lacking. This research contributes to the data
   journalism discourse by exploring audience involvement in data-driven
   storytelling and advocating for public participation in data journalism
   projects to enhance reporting and understand data's societal role. It
   also underscores the value of geojournalism skills in delivering spatial
   products and thematic maps, adding context and insights beyond numerical
   data. Eco-Nai + exemplifies the potential for data journalism to bridge
   information gaps and drive meaningful conversations in an increasingly
   data-centric world.},

Title = {Designing a Human-centred Learning Analytics Dashboard In-use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in applying human-centred design methods to
   create learning analytics (LA) systems, most efforts have concentrated
   on initial design phases, with limited exploration of how LA tools and
   practices can co-evolve during the actual learning and teaching
   activities. This paper examines how a human-centred LA dashboard can be
   further refined and adapted by teachers while actively using it in a
   real-world scenario (i.e., design-in-use),beyond its intended design
   (i.e., design-for-use). We use instrumental genesis as a theoretical
   lens to analyze the temporary and permanent instrumentalization of
   design features and individual and collective instrumentation of the LA
   dashboard. The analysis of semi-structured individual interviews with
   five nursing teachers who used an LA dashboard to guide team reflections
   with 224 students (56 teams) revealed technical and pedagogical changes
   that occurred in both the system's features (instrumentalization) and
   teaching practices (instrumentation). We found that teachers adopted the
   LA dashboard beyond initially intended ways by (i) providing emotional
   support with the analytics, (ii) reducing details in AI-powered data
   visualizations for easier comprehension, (iii) creating data narratives
   to address data limitations, and (iv) collectively developing new
   practices to use the LA dashboard for co-teaching. Therefore, teachers'
   design-in-use of the LA dashboard highlights the ongoing need for design
   improvements to address challenges posed by dynamic data and complex
   algorithms underlying AI and analytics interfaces.},

Abstract = {Graph or network data are widely studied in both data mining and
   visualization communities to review the relationship among different
   entities and groups. The data facts derived from graph visual analysis
   are important to help understand the social structures of complex data,
   especially for data journalism. However, it is challenging for data
   journalists to discover graph data facts and manually organize
   correlated facts around a meaningful topic due to the complexity of
   graph data and the difficulty to interpret graph narratives. Therefore,
   we present an automatic graph facts generation system, Calliope-Net,
   which consists of a fact discovery module, a fact organization module,
   and a visualization module. It creates annotated node-link diagrams with
   facts automatically discovered and organized from network data. A novel
   layout algorithm is designed to present meaningful and visually
   appealing annotated graphs. We evaluate the proposed system with two
   case studies and an in-lab user study. The results show that
   Calliope-Net can benefit users in discovering and understanding graph
   data facts with visually pleasing annotated visualizations.},

Abstract = {When telling a data story, an author has an intention they seek to
   convey to an audience. This intention can be of many forms such as to
   persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to
   expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable
   and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories,
   numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a
   plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create
   the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life
   by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable,
   memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the
   analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and
   identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we
   illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of
   ``character-oriented design{''}. We identify the roles and visual
   representations data characters assume as well as the types of
   relationships these roles have with one another. We identify
   characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data
   stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the
   audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify
   their visual representations. We then illustrate ``character-oriented
   design{''} by showing how to develop data characters with common data
   story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters
   derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data
   storytelling process using character-oriented design. To access our

Title = {The effects of visualisation literacy and data storytelling dashboards

Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) dashboards are becoming increasingly available
   in various learning settings. However, teachers may face challenges in
   understanding and interpreting the data visualisations presented on
   those dashboards. In response to this, some LA researchers are
   incorporating visual cueing techniques, like data storytelling (DS),
   into LA dashboard design to reduce the data visualisation skills - often
   referred to as visualisation literacy (VL) - and cognitive effort
   required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. However, despite the
   potential of DS principles in simplifying data visualisations, there is
   limited evidence supporting their effectiveness in actually reducing
   teachers' cognitive load. The study presented in this paper addresses
   this gap by investigating the potential impact of LA dashboards, with
   and without DS elements, on teachers with varying VL levels. Through a
   quasi -experimental study involving 23 teachers, we analysed changes in
   pupil dilation - a proxy for cognitive load - as they examined LA
   dashboards featuring student data captured while participating in
   synchronous, online collaborative learning tasks. Our findings suggest
   DS can reduce cognitive load, particularly for teachers with lower VL.
   These results provide insight into the effects of DS and VL on teachers'
   cognitive load, thereby informing the design of LA dashboards.

Abstract = {Timelines are essential for visually communicating chronological
   narratives and reflecting on the personal and cultural significance of
   historical events. Existing visualization tools tend to support
   conventional linear representations, but fail to capture personal
   idiosyncratic conceptualizations of time. In response, we built
   TimeSplines, a visualization authoring tool that allows people to sketch
   multiple free-form temporal axes and populate them with heterogeneous,
   time-oriented data via incremental and lazy data binding. Authors can
   bend, compress, and expand temporal axes to emphasize or de-emphasize
   intervals based on their personal importance; they can also annotate the
   axes with text and figurative elements to convey contextual information.
   The results of two user studies show how people appropriate the concepts
   in TimeSplines to express their own conceptualization of time, while our
   curated gallery of images demonstrates the expressive potential of our
   approach.},

Abstract = {Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data
   stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data
   videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an
   intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the
   underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands
   a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor,
   including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with
   narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio
   narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify
   this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data
   Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with
   narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical
   barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To
   enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references
   between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts
   data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes
   large language models to form semantic connections between text and
   visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as
   computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of
   suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced
   by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player's efficacy
   through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews. The
   evaluation results demonstrated that Data Player can generate
   high-quality data videos that are comparable to human-composed ones.},

Abstract = {Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their
   creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight
   discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the
   communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data
   storytelling techniques, however, tend to overlook the importance of
   user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the
   system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's
   intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that
   leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to
   customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for
   existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback
   through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and
   dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the
   user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals.
   We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the
   implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a
   quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to
   a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that
   Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of
   insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the
   usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and
   highlight areas of future work.},

   ponders on a series of ethico-onto-epistemological questions about data

Abstract = {The Sound of Water (https://flow-mer.org.au/napnap) microsite documents
   an environmental intervention at Nap Nap Swamp, a wetland in the western
   reaches of Australia's Murrumbidgee River. A collaboration between a
   designer (Whitelaw) and an ecologist (Wassens), it was supported by the
   Commonwealth Environmental Water Office. We use audiovisual data
   storytelling to engage audiences with Nap Nap as it transitions from a
   dry to wet state. Focusing on a 9-day period in mid-2020, we combine
   audio and hydrological data to show the ecosystem's response to a
   managed environmental flow, narrating this change through the wetland's
   charismatic frog species, including the threatened Southern Bell Frog.
   In this paper we reflect on the technical and creative contributions of
   the project in visualising environmental audio, as well as its
   significance for wider practice. We highlight the value of creatively
   re-purposing ecological data and the importance of multi-stakeholder
   networks, and we argue that our celebration in this project of
   environmental management, intervention and care should be a key concern
   for future digital ecologies practices.},

   (named FlexShape), which is simple yet overcomes skew information and
   bimodality in historical data, as part of the complex learning task.
   Results showed that the proposed framework enables it to handle unit
   data sets. As an example, we presented data storytelling from the water
   particle monitoring (relative humidity) from one Atacama Desert station,
   known to be one of the driest areas on Earth, across hidden patterns
   such as inundation and microweather. Finally, the developed framework
   makes possible any research on the univariate unit data decision-making,
   enabling the database import and adjusting some parametric models, and
   enabling the comparison of different units' distribution

Abstract = {Sports clubs and other sports organizations are important to modern
   society because their activities provide important values linked to
   sports. This article focuses on the passive consumption of sports as a
   leisure activity that brings fans joy, a sense of belonging, and other
   values associated with their favourite sport and club. For sports club
   managers to achieve sustainable operation associated with sufficient
   funds obtained from fans, they can apply various ways of involving the
   fans themselves in creating a loyal community and in selected managerial
   issues. The article's aim is to describe the current level of knowledge
   in this area and follow it up with practical recommendations for the
   effective setting of the involvement of fans in selected processes. The
   applied methodology uses several methods, such as case studies, analysis
   of statistical data, storytelling, or the creation of flow charts
   describing the new setting of the processes in question. Data describing
   selected examples from practice and case studies were obtained from
   available Internet sources. However, the research results were
   supplemented by the analysis of data provided by the football
   association, which covers this sport at the national level within the
   Slevensk Republic. The main findings of the presented research include
   the fact that the involvement of fans in sports club management issues
   is often associated with concerns on the part of managers. Therefore, it
   is recommended to plan and implement the successive steps of this
   involvement, starting with involvement in the creation of a loyal fan
   community.},

Abstract = {Large-scale issues with a spatial and temporal context such as the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the war against Ukraine, and climate change have
   given visual storytelling with data a lot of attention in online
   journalism, confirming its high effectiveness and relevance for
   conveying stories. Thus, new ways have emerged that expand the space of
   visual storytelling techniques. However, interactive visual data stories
   with a spatio-temporal context have not been extensively studied yet.
   Particularly quantitative information about the used layout and media,
   the visual storytelling techniques, and the visual encoding of
   space-time is relevant to get a deeper understanding of how such stories
   are commonly built to convey complex information in a comprehensible
   way. Covering these three aspects, we propose a design space derived by
   merging and adjusting existing approaches, which we used to categorize
   130 collected web-based visual data stories with a spatio-temporal
   context from between 2018 and 2022. An analyzis of the collected data
   reveals the power of large-scale issues to shape the landscape of
   storytelling techniques and a trend towards a simplified consumability
   of stories. Taken together, our findings can serve story authors as
   inspiration regarding which storytelling techniques to include in their
   own spatio-temporal data stories.},

Abstract = {With the development of ICT, numerous digital practices and tools have
   emerged, which at first glance appear to be means of ``care of the
   Self{''}, but a critical stance often reveals their disciplinary nature.
   The aim of this article is to suggest a criterion that distinguishes
   latent disciplinary `` technologies of the Self{''} from genuinely
   productive and emancipatory digital practices of self-transformation. I
   examine the practice of data analysis as a technologically mediated,
   motivated epistemic practice, which, in my opinion, fits within
   Foucault's concept of ``care of the Self{''}. This is maintained by my
   experience of conducting data literacy bootcamps, which showed that
   working with data has a potential for agency development. As to the
   accessibility of data analysis practices, I see that they have long
   extended beyond IT companies, becoming available to the public in a
   variety of contexts, from data journalism to data literacy education
   programs for teenagers. Data analysis as a digital practice is examined
   within the framework of Andrew Pickering's account of scientific
   practices as ``dance of agencies{''}. Pickering argues that human agency
   and disciplinary (discursive) agency are not separate or distinct but
   are rather intertwined and co-constitutive. The researcher constructs
   data-driven narratives that allow them to position themselves in
   relation to the data and phenomena that are publicly represented through
   them, and to reconfigure power/knowledge discourses accordingly. To
   distinguish between disciplinary and genuinely self-transformative
   ``technologies of the Self{''}, I propose a two-stage Productive Action
   concept suggested by Boris Elkonin within cultural-historical
   psychology. The result of fulfilled productive action is a change of
   one's local ontological model. I demonstrate how productive action in
   digital educational practice can contribute to the development of
   students' personally significant ontologies. The special significance of
   working with social and humanitarian data as a prerequisite of such an
   outcome is discussed. The article was prepared as a part of the
   state-assigned research work of the Russian Presidential Academy of
   National Economy and Public Administration.},

Title = {Urban Waste Management and Prediction through Socio-Economic Values and

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Enhancing data-driven decision-making is vital for waste authorities.
   Although few studies have explored the influence of socio-economic
   indicators on waste tonnage, comprehensive analysis of urban waste data
   focusing on geographical information is also scarce. There is a dearth
   of dashboards for visualizing waste tonnage with spatial relationship
   maps. This study aims to present a prediction model useful for
   estimating urban waste by using personal income (I), the number of
   income earners (E), land values (L), the estimated resident population
   (P) and population density (D), called the IELPD measures. An innovative
   approach is developed to identify the correlation between urban
   household waste data and socio-economic factors and develop an advanced
   dashboard based on a geographic information system (GIS). To accomplish
   this, relationship maps and regression analysis are deployed to
   visualize household waste data spanning six years of waste production in
   New South Wales, Australia, classified into three categories:
   recyclable, residual and organic (RRO) wastes. Furthermore, this
   classification enables accessing the association between these three
   waste categories and the IELPD metrics. And there are four types of
   visualization generated, that is, thematic mapping, spatial relationship
   maps, correlation matrices and dashboard development. The regression
   analysis shows a substantial association between RRO waste tonnage,
   population changes and a minor correlation with land values. Overall,
   this study contributes to urban waste data storytelling and its
   spatiotemporal associations with socio-economic determinants. This paper
   offers a valuable prediction model of the IELPD metrics to estimate
   urban waste and visualize them in a dashboard allowing practitioners and
   decision-makers to track trends in the RRO waste stream in urban waste
   generally.},

Abstract = {This study explored the narratives of low-income school learners' sense
   of belonging in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It provided a historical
   overview of the South African Apartheid system. The study employed the
   narrative inquiry approach of the qualitative research design and is
   hinged on the constructivist paradigm. Purposive sampling was used in
   selecting a school, and learners in Grade 8 and 9 consisted of 8 boys
   and 8 girls each. Data (narratives of the learners) were collected
   through Focus Group Discussion and analysed using the three-dimensional
   space inquiry tools - broadening, burrowing, and storying and
   re-storying. Findings revealed the prevalence of poverty, school
   disengagement, and stigmatisation among learners in low-income schools.
   Thus, the effects of poverty on learners lead to their feelings of
   desolation and futility as they experience what is known as a
   low-control-of-effects syndrome. The hope that education may change
   their lives seems to be superseded and dampened by what transpires in
   their poor homes and schools.},

Abstract = {We present a methodology for making sense of the communicative role of
   data visualizations in journalistic storytelling and share findings from
   surveying water-related data stories. Data stories are a genre of
   long-form journalism that integrate text, data visualization, and other
   visual expressions (e.g., photographs, illustrations, videos) for the
   purpose of data-driven storytelling. In the last decade, a considerable
   number of data stories about a wide range of topics have been published
   worldwide. Authors use a variety of techniques to make complex phenomena
   comprehensible and use visualizations as communicative devices that
   shape the understanding of a given topic. Despite the popularity of data
   stories, we, as scholars, still lack a methodological framework for
   assessing the communicative role of visualizations in data stories. To
   this extent, we draw from data journalism, visual culture, and
   multimodality studies to propose an interpretative framework in six
   stages. The process begins with the analysis of content blocks and
   framing elements and ends with the identification of dimensions,
   patterns, and relationships between textual and visual elements. The
   framework is put to the test by analyzing 17 data stories about
   water-related issues. Our observations from the survey illustrate how
   data visualizations can shape the framing of complex topics.},

Abstract = {Authors use various media formats to convey disease information to a
   broad audience, from articles and videos to interviews or documentaries.
   These media often include human characters, such as patients or treating
   physicians, who are involved with the disease. While artistic media,
   such as hand-crafted illustrations and animations are used for health
   communication in many cases, our goal is to focus on data-driven
   visualizations. Over the last decade, narrative visualization has
   experienced increasing prominence, employing storytelling techniques to
   present data in an understandable way. Similar to classic storytelling
   formats, narrative medical visualizations may also take a human
   character-centered design approach. However, the impact of this form of
   data communication on the user is largely unexplored. This study
   investigates the protagonist's influence on user experience in terms of
   engagement, identification, self-referencing, emotional response,
   perceived credibility, and time spent in the story. Our experimental
   setup utilizes a character-driven story structure for disease stories
   derived from Joseph Campbell's Hero's Journey. Using this structure, we
   generated three conditions for a cerebral small vessel disease story
   that vary by their protagonist: (1) a patient, (2) a physician, and (3)
   a base condition with no human protagonist. These story variants formed
   the basis for our hypotheses on the effect of a human protagonist in
   disease stories, which we evaluated in an online study with 30
   participants. Our findings indicate that a human protagonist exerts
   various influences on the story perception and that these also vary
   depending on the type of protagonist.},

Abstract = {Utilizing Visualization-oriented Natural Language Interfaces (V-NLI) as
   a complementary input modality to direct manipulation for visual
   analytics can provide an engaging user experience. It enables users to
   focus on their tasks rather than having to worry about how to operate
   visualization tools on the interface. In the past two decades,
   leveraging advanced natural language processing technologies, numerous
   V-NLI systems have been developed in academic research and commercial
   software, especially in recent years. In this article, we conduct a
   comprehensive review of the existing V-NLIs. In order to classify each
   article, we develop categorical dimensions based on a classic
   information visualization pipeline with the extension of a V-NLI layer.
   The following seven stages are used: query interpretation, data
   transformation, visual mapping, view transformation, human interaction,
   dialogue management, and presentation. Finally, we also shed light on
   several promising directions for future work in the V-NLI community.},

Abstract = {We present Roslingifier, a data-driven storytelling method for animated
   scatterplots. Like its namesake, Hans Rosling (1948-2017), a professor
   of public health and a spellbinding public speaker, Roslingifier turns a
   sequence of entities changing over time-such as countries and continents
   with their demographic data-into an engaging narrative elling the story
   of the data. This data-driven storytelling method with an in-person
   presenter is a new genre of storytelling technique and has never been
   studied before. In this article, we aim to define a design space for
   this new genre-data presentation-and provide a semi-automated authoring
   tool for helping presenters create quality presentations. From an
   in-depth analysis of video clips of presentations using interactive
   visualizations, we derive three specific techniques to achieve this:
   natural language narratives, visual effects that highlight events, and
   temporal branching that changes playback time of the animation. Our
   implementation of the Roslingifier method is capable of identifying and
   clustering significant movements, automatically generating visual
   highlighting and a narrative for playback, and enabling the user to
   customize. From two user studies, we show that Roslingifier allows users
   to effectively create engaging data stories and the system features help
   both presenters and viewers find diverse insights.},

Abstract = {Recent studies suggest that RDM practices are not yet properly
   integrated into daily research workflows, nor supported by any tools
   researchers typically use. To help close this gap, we have elaborated a
   design concept called `Data Story' drawing on ideas from (digital) data
   storytelling and aiming at facilitating the appropriation of RDM
   practices, in particular data curation, sharing and reuse. Our focus was
   on researchers working mainly with qualitative data in their daily
   workflows. Data Story integrates traditional data curation approaches
   with a more narrative, contextual, and collaborative organizational
   layer that can be thought of as a `story'. Our findings come from a
   long-term `embedded' evaluation of the concept and show that: (1)
   engaging with Data Story has many potential benefits, as for example
   peer learning opportunities, better data overview, and organization of
   analytical insights; (2) Data Story can effectively address data
   curation issues such as standardization and unconformity; and (3) it
   addresses a broader set of issues and concerns that are less dealt with
   in the current state of play such as lack of motivation and stylistic
   choices. Our contribution, based on lessons learnt, is to provide a new
   design approach for RDM and for new collaborative research data
   practices, one grounded in narrative structures, capable of negotiating
   between top-down policies and bottom-up practices, and which supports
   `reflective' learning opportunities - with and about data - of many
   kinds.},

Abstract = {Visualization (i.e., the use of figures and images to represent findings
   and conceptual models) is central to theorizing. Yet, by focusing solely
   on the textual content of papers, analysis has inadvertently
   marginalized the graphic representations of key ideas. We review the
   paradox literature not just in terms of what authors have written but
   also how they have visualized models concisely. An analysis of figures
   in paradox articles captures the essential role that visuals play in our
   understanding of competing tensions, leveraging the power of imagery. We
   explore paradox visually, searching for the figurative materialization
   of paradox; more particularly, we seek visual signs that render abstract
   ideas more saliently and concretely. We contribute to paradox theory in
   three ways. First, we show how visuals constitute the lynchpin between
   convergent and divergent forces, allowing scholars to simultaneously
   reinforce and challenge current understanding. Second, we offer a tool
   for scholars to theorize competing demands based on three key
   antinomies, or dualities, that define the terrain of research in our
   field. Third, we reveal the performative effect of figures by
   identifying the ongoing dominance of certain classes of paradox visuals,
   which allows us to point to uncharted territories for paradox research.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LOSS PREVENTION IN THE PROCESS INDUSTRIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {83},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accidents in the process industry involve several interacting factors,
   including human and organizational factors (HOFs). A long-standing
   obstacle to HOFs analysis is lack of data. Accident reports are an
   essential data source to learn from the past and contain HOFs-related
   data, but they are usually unstructured text in a not standardized
   format. Some studies have explored the extraction of information
   automatically from accident reports based on Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) techniques. However, they were not dedicated to HOFs. Risk
   communication is considered an essential pillar in safety and risk
   science. This research develops a HOFs-focused risk commu-nication
   framework based on the NLP techniques that can support risk assessment
   and mitigation. The proposed approach automatically extracts the target
   groups oriented ``Who, When, Where, Why{''} (4Ws) information from
   accident reports. This framework was applied to explore the eMARS
   database. The results show that the ``4Ws{''} skeleton of narratives has
   appreciated performance in pattern recognition and holistic information
   analysis. The graphical representation interfaces are designed to
   display the features of HOFs-related accidents, which can better be
   communicated to the sharp-end operators and decision-makers.},

Abstract = {Narrative visualization is characterized by the integration of data
   visualization and storytelling techniques. These characteristics provide
   challenges in its evaluation. Little is known about how these evaluation
   challenges are addressed by narrative visualization practitioners. We
   surveyed experienced narrative visualization practitioners to
   investigate their methods of evaluation. To gain deeper insight we
   conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with practitioners. We
   found that there is usually an informal approach to narrative
   visualization evaluation, where practitioners rely on prior experience
   and their peers for evaluation. Our study also revealed novel approaches
   to evaluation. We introduce a practice-led heuristic framework to aid
   practitioners to evaluate narrative visualization systematically. Our
   practice-led heuristic framework couples first-hand practitioner
   experience with recent research literature. This work sheds light on how
   to address narrative visualization evaluation to better inform both

Abstract = {In this article, we contest globalised notions of data as `universally'

   and in varied national contexts. We reveal how data are transient and
   often erroneous, even as data appear omnipresent and omnipotent.
   Employing an auto-ethnographic storytelling approach, we draw upon our
   diverse experiences as educators working within and across multiple
   national and subnational contexts - in England, Singapore, Bangladesh
   and Australia - to reflect on how data have reconstituted and
   recalibrated our experiences in school and university settings. We seek
   to break the `myth' of data - that we cannot live without the supposedly
   complete construction of work and life that dominant, reductive
   assemblages of data provide. In doing so, we argue for the reimagination
   and demystification of broader data regimes.},

   misunderstandings. We contribute a series of studies to investigate how
   to effectively introduce visualizations to the audience with varying
   degrees of visualization literacy. We begin with understanding how
   people are introducing visualizations. We crowdsource 110 introductions
   of visualizations and categorize them based on their content and
   structures. From these crowdsourced introductions, we identify different
   introduction strategies and generate a set of introductions for
   evaluation. We conduct experiments to systematically compare the
   effectiveness of different introduction strategies across four
   visualizations with 1,080 participants. We find that introductions
   explaining visual encodings with concrete examples are the most
   effective. Our study provides both qualitative and quantitative insights
   into how to construct effective verbal introductions of visualizations
   in presentations, inspiring further research in data storytelling.},

Abstract = {Visual data storytelling is gaining importance as a means of presenting
   data-driven information or analysis results, especially to the general
   public. This has resulted in design principles being proposed for
   data-driven storytelling, and new authoring tools being created to aid
   such storytelling. However, data analysts typically lack sufficient
   background in design and storytelling to make effective use of these
   principles and authoring tools. To assist this process, we present
   ChartStory for crafting data stories from a collection of user-created
   charts, using a style akin to comic panels to imply the underlying
   sequence and logic of data-driven narratives. Our approach is to
   operationalize established design principles into an advanced pipeline
   that characterizes charts by their properties and similarities to each
   other, and recommends ways to partition, layout, and caption story
   pieces to serve a narrative. ChartStory also augments this pipeline with
   intuitive user interactions for visual refinement of generated data
   comics. We extensively and holistically evaluate ChartStory via a trio
   of studies. We first assess how the tool supports data comic creation in
   comparison to a manual baseline tool. Data comics from this study are
   subsequently compared and evaluated to ChartStory's automated
   recommendations by a team of narrative visualization practitioners. This
   is followed by a pair of interview studies with data scientists using
   their own datasets and charts who provide an additional assessment of
   the system. We find that ChartStory provides cogent recommendations for
   narrative generation, resulting in data comics that compare favorably to
   manually-created ones.},

Journal = {DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {In this paper, I develop an online website that assists users in
   answering the question, ``What do you need to remove in order to erase
   {[}thing] from {[}your life or society]?{''} through network
   visualization methods. This project subverts the typical data
   visualization strategy of working with extant data by encouraging users
   to produce data, demonstrating how data visualization techniques can
   constitute a way of thinking and creating rather than just analyzing and
   representing. However, this tool and its affordances are primarily a
   case study for a sociological approach to critical design in the Digital
   Humanities: By critically examining the tool itself (as well as the
   process that created it), I am able to pose the broader questions of (1)
   how does the creation of digital tools and projects reflect a
   theoretical interpretation of the social world and its processes, and
   (2) how can these interpretations constitute the data of sociological
   studies? In resolving these questions, I suggest that critical design
   can be viewed as theory, experiment, and data: designs constitute a
   social theory, data can be experimentally produced within this social
   theory, and encouraging reflective design can turn the social theories
   of design themselves into data.},

Abstract = {The following study addresses, from a design perspective, narrative
   visualization using augmented reality (AR) in real physical spaces, and
   specifically in spaces with no semantic relation with the represented
   data. We intend to identify the aspects augmented reality adds, as
   narrative possibilities, to data visualization. Particularly, we seek to
   identify the aspects augmented reality introduces regarding the three
   dimensions of narrative visualization-view, focus and sequence. For this
   purpose, we adopted a comparative analysis of a set of fifty case
   studies, specifically, narrative visualizations using augmented reality
   from a journalistic scope, where narrative is a key feature. Despite the
   strong explanatory character that characterizes the set of analyzed
   cases, which sometimes limits the user's agency, there is a strong
   interactive factor. It was found that augmented reality can expand the
   narrative possibilities in the three dimensions mentioned-view, focus
   and sequence-but especially regarding visual strategies where simulation
   plays an essential role. As a visual strategy, simulation can provide
   the context for communication or be the object of communication itself,
   as a replica.},

Abstract = {While the consumption of visual information becomes a daily commodity
   integrated into our lives, data visualisation is dominated by dashboards
   and charts. The main contribution of this article is an advanced way to
   visualise data as a data story. We converged paradigms from digital
   storytelling, serious games, and data visualisation to turn data into
   useful insights. The creation, management, and analysis of data have
   been increasingly given more attention in industry and professional
   practices. However, the potential of packaging data and analytic results
   into easily digestible and visually explorable content intended for
   non-professional audiences has not yet been investigated to its full
   extent. We contributed towards overcoming the gap between data analytics
   and data presentation. By integrating a story-like environment and
   entertainment into data visualisation, we explore the possibilities of
   efficiently communicating data and insights to general audiences in a
   casual context. We present this modular approach to customising messages
   for visual data storytelling from an information and communication
   perspective, including a test prototype developed to illustrate our data

Abstract = {Collocated teamwork remains a pervasive practice across all professional
   sectors. Even though live observations and video analysis have been
   utilized for understanding embodied interaction of team members, these
   approaches are impractical for scaling up the provision of feedback that
   can promote developing high-performance teamwork skills. Enriching
   spaces with sensors capable of automatically capturing team activity
   data can improve learning and reflection. Yet, connecting the enormous
   amounts of data such sensors can generate with constructs related to
   teamwork remains challenging. This article presents a framework to
   support the development of human-centered embodied teamwork analytics by
   1) enabling hybrid human-machine multimodal sensing; 2) embedding
   educators' and experts' knowledge into computational team models; and 3)
   generating human-driven data storytelling interfaces for reflection and
   decision making. This is illustrated through an in-the-wild study in the
   context of healthcare simulation, where predictive modeling, epistemic
   network analysis, and data storytelling are used to support educators

Abstract = {Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see
   as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner
   community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and
   efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines
   suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data
   values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the
   emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines
   for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that
   describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant
   data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written
   annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated
   how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information
   across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six
   graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously
   seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to
   rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and
   trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on
   professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on

Title = {Designing narratives and data visuals in comic form for social influence
   in climate action},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {SEP 27},
Abstract = {Climate change is difficult to connect with personally, because people
   only regard the phenomenon as important if it becomes a perceived threat
   to themselves. Arguments like statistics and policy debates are
   extrinsic motivators, which do not necessarily align people's own
   intrinsic motives with those of climate action. Instead, narratives and
   visual communication can influence viewers implicitly by the way they
   show and reinforce actions and thoughts that align with climate action.
   In this design study, we used comics created for human-level climate
   change influence to promote ideas like future-based thinking, sharing of
   responsibility, and caring for each other. We also created data visuals
   that illustrate future consequences of climate change for the purpose of
   averting negative alternative realities. To see whether our design can
   affect audience perception of climate change on the human level of goals
   and desires, we showed the comics to readers unfamiliar with the themes
   of the stories, presenting them as manga about characters and
   situations. The survey showed that data stories can affect the way naive
   readers interpret narratives to align with pro-climate attitudes such as
   sharing and future-vision, and that readers are focused on the
   human-level of the data and story as opposed to the physical resource
   level. Speculative fiction and data visuals provide a potentially
   effective way to influence individuals' climate change attitudes by
   showing alternative realities and attributes of collective
   responsibility and planning-for-the-future as data stories.},

Title = {A Geo-Social Characterization of Health Impact from Air Pollution in
   Mexico Valley},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {AUG 29},
Abstract = {The impact of the air pollution phenomenon has been long studied, but
   most often with a fragmented approach, without closely looking at the
   relationship between different components that characterize it, such as
   sensor-based data, health data from institutional databases, and data on
   how it is perceived by human beings in social media. The research
   developed in this study introduces an integrated methodological
   framework that analyses sensor data on air pollution distributed in
   space and time, combined with health data and social data narratives
   that reflect how different communities perceive this phenomenon in space
   and time; exploring how these different heterogeneous sources can be
   combined to better understand the impact of air pollution phenomena at
   the large-city level in the Valley of Mexico. We introduce a
   Spatio-temporal data integration and mining framework that aims to
   discover trends and insights regarding the distribution of the impact of
   an air pollution phenomenon in terms of human health and perception. The
   main peculiarity of our methodological framework is the integration of
   different large data sources by combining a series of methods: NLP
   (topic modeling), data mining (data cubes, unsupervised learning, and
   clustering), and GIS capabilities (spatial interpolation, choropleth
   maps) that together provide a better understanding of the quantitative
   and qualitative patterns emerging at a different spatial scale and
   temporal granularity. Overall, this shows how social data, when combined
   with quantitative data, can provide a better understanding of the impact
   of a given phenomenon, such as air pollution.},

Abstract = {This paper explores narrative techniques combined with medical
   visualizations to tell data-driven stories about diseases for a general
   audience. The field of medical illustration uses narrative visualization
   through hand-crafted techniques to promote health literacy. However,
   data-driven narrative visualization has rarely been applied to medical
   data. We derived a template for creating stories about diseases and
   applied it to three selected diseases to demonstrate how narrative
   techniques could support visual communication and facilitate
   understanding of medical data. One of our main considerations is how
   interactive 3D anatomical models can be integrated into the story and
   whether this leads to compelling stories in which the users feel
   involved. A between-subject study with 90 participants suggests that the
   combination of a carefully designed narrative structure, the constant
   involvement of a specific patient, high-qualitative visualizations
   combined with easy-to-use interactions, are critical for an
   understandable story about diseases that would be remembered by
   participants. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Interactive visualizations play a key part in the exploration and
   analysis of data, and in the creation of visual data stories. This paper
   describes a new graph-based framework for developing interactive
   visualizations for creating coherent visual data stories. We have
   realized our framework in a prototype tool named Gravity++. Gravity++
   uses a novel graph architecture for modeling interaction, data
   navigation, and changes in visual representation to better communicate
   findings to an audience. The combination of these graph models provides
   better support and flexibility for designing interactive visualizations,
   data navigation, and visual data stories. We demonstrate the
   applicability of this framework by two example usage scenarios. We also
   report on an evaluation study conducted with representative
   participants. All participants successfully created meaningful visual
   data stories with a high level of complexity. Our results also show that
   Gravity++ is easy to use and supports the understanding and sense-making
   of the visual data story creation process.},

Abstract = {In this article, we share some poststructuralist ideas for interacting
   and intra-acting with photos as visual data in qualitative inquiry. The
   discussion of photos as visual data has mostly drawn from
   representational perspectives. Furthermore, poststructuralist theorizing
   has been mostly utilized to discuss discursive data. Drawing from
   poststructuralist ideas, like Derrida's discussion of the
   absent-presence, we offer a poststructuralist glance at photos as
   spectral visual data. We view such approach as liberating of visual
   texts and as denotative of the unfinalizability of meaning. To
   illustrate our point, we engage into a dual mode of narrative, of both
   words and images, that is photos. Following a brief overview situating
   the use of photos as data within a representational framework in
   qualitative research, we illustrate our poststructuralist glance
   inspired by a Derridean framework. As an epilogue, we share reflections
   in the form of questions aiming to challenge our narrative in this
   article.},

   process model for dashboard onboarding that formalizes and unifies such
   diverse onboarding strategies. Our model introduces the onboarding loop
   alongside the dashboard usage loop. Unpacking the onboarding loop
   reveals how each onboarding strategy combines selected building blocks
   of the dashboard with an onboarding narrative. Specific means are
   applied to this narration sequence for onboarding, which results in
   onboarding artifacts that are presented to the user via an interface. We
   concretize these concepts by showing how our process model can be used
   to describe a selection of real-world onboarding examples. Finally, we
   discuss how our model can serve as an actionable blueprint for
   developing new onboarding systems.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Narrative sensemaking is a fundamental process to understand sequential
   information. Narrative maps are a visual representation framework that
   can aid analysts in their narrative sensemaking process. Narrative maps
   allow analysts to understand the big picture of a narrative, uncover new
   relationships between events, and model the connection between
   storylines. We seek to understand how analysts create and use narrative
   maps in order to obtain design guidelines for an interactive
   visualization tool for narrative maps that can aid analysts in narrative
   sensemaking. We perform two experiments with a data set of news
   articles. The insights extracted from our studies can be used to design
   narrative maps, extraction algorithms, and visual analytics tools to
   support the narrative sensemaking process. The contributions of this
   paper are three-fold: (1) an analysis of how analysts construct
   narrative maps; (2) a user evaluation of specific narrative map
   features; and (3) design guidelines for narrative maps. Our findings
   suggest ways for designing narrative maps and extraction algorithms, as
   well as providing insights toward useful interactions. We discuss these
   insights and design guidelines and reflect on the potential challenges
   involved. As key highlights, we find that narrative maps should avoid
   redundant connections that can be inferred by using the transitive
   property of event connections, reducing the overall complexity of the
   map. Moreover, narrative maps should use multiple types of cognitive
   connections between events such as topical and causal connections, as
   this emulates the strategies that analysts use in the narrative
   sensemaking process.},

Abstract = {The article documents connections and synergies between city museums'
   visions and programming as well as emerging smart city issues and
   dilemmas in a fast-paced urban environment marked with the processes of
   increasing digitalization and datafication. The research employs
   policy/document analysis and semi-structured interviews with smart city
   government representatives and museum professionals to investigating
   both smart city policy frameworks as well as city museum's data-driven
   installations and activities in New York, London and Singapore. A
   comparative program analysis of the Singapore City Gallery, Museum of
   the City of New York and Museum of London identifies such sites of data
   practices as Data storytelling, interpretation and eco-curation.
   Discussing these sites as dedicated spaces of smart citizen engagement,
   the article reveals that city museums can either empower their visitors
   to consider their roles as active city co-makers or see them as passive
   recipients of the smart city transformations.},

Abstract = {Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public
   presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the
   domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows
   comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication
   around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive
   briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with
   individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to
   audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit
   our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data
   scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with
   visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a
   retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from
   which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We
   describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small
   collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more
   structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational
   performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or
   customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three
   design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the
   progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a
   narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the
   audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with
   interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees' responses
   surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating
   accessible and engaging audience experiences.},

Abstract = {News outlets are increasingly developing formats dedicated to capturing

   separately. To fill this literature gap, this study identifies and
   analyzes the use of data journalism on social media content of AJ Labs,
   the team dedicated to producing data-driven and interactive stories for
   the Al Jazeera news network. Drawing upon a mixed-method approach, this
   study examines the use and characteristics of data stories on Instagram.
   Results suggest that there is reliance on producing visual content that
   covers topics such as politics and violence. In general, AJ Labs relies
   on the use of reproducible formats and produces its own unique data. To
   conclude, we suggest potential ways to improve the use of Instagram to
   tell data stories.},

Title = {Automatic Narrative Summarization for Visualizing Cyber Security Logs

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {28},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1182-1190},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cyber security logs and incident reports describe a narrative, but in
   practice analysts view the data in tables where it can be difficult to
   follow the narrative. Narrative visualizations are useful, but common
   examples use a summarized narrative instead of the full story's
   narrative; it is unclear how to automatically generate these summaries.
   This paper presents (1) a narrative summarization algorithm to reduce
   the size and complexity of cyber security narratives with a
   user-customizable summarization level, and (2) a narrative visualization
   tailored for incident reports and network logs. An evaluation on real
   incident reports shows that the summarization algorithm reduces false
   positives and improves average precision by 41\% while reducing average
   incident report size up to 79\%. Together, the visualization and
   summarization algorithm generate compact representations of cyber
   narratives that earned praise from a SOC analyst. We further demonstrate
   that the summarization algorithm can apply to other types of dynamic
   graphs by automatically generating a summary of the Les Miserables
   character interaction graph. We find that the list of main characters in
   the automatically generated summary has substantial agreement with
   human-generated summaries. A version of this paper, data, and code is

Abstract = {Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are
   widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They
   provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message
   and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is
   difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We
   investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in
   data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design
   space of chart-text references through news articles and scientific
   papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative
   interface enabling users to construct interactive references between
   text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to
   automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually
   construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with
   algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface
   provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.},

Title = {Storytelling the war. Social media listening as a transmedia resource in
   the context of the algorithmic turn},
Journal = {H-ERMES-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {55-86},
Abstract = {In the context of the hybrid media system, the transmedia author
   develops his or her creative action through social platforms
   characterized by programmability, popularity, connectivity, and
   datafication (van Dijck \& Poell, 2013). Such logics may constitute a
   limitation for the author with respect to the ability to manage the
   fruition of the content once it is placed on algorithmic platforms.
   However, they also open up new opportunities for listening to user
   engagement. This is important for transmedia storytelling of
   controversial issues such as war that could trigger polarization or
   rejection by connected audiences. From the perspective of production,
   film and television content that addresses such issues involves longer
   planning time frames than the social campaigns that will accompany
   distribution. For these, it becomes crucial for the transmedia author to
   analyze the ongoing debate on the topic of the primary text, so as to
   positively influence the online reception of the audiovisual work.
   Drawing from the analysis of transmedia projects on the wars of the new
   millennium, the essay identifies a crucial transitional phase in which
   social media assume an increasingly relevant role in the design of
   engagement. This context distinguishes the methodological approach to
   social listening based on digital methods and critical metrics (Rogers,
   2019, Stewart \& Arnold, 2018) described in the essay. The proposal aims
   to move beyond net-nographic or quantitative approaches to the analysis
   of interactions in social media to delineate ``listening{''} as a
   resource not only for devising resonant engagement strategies with
   respect to the storytelling of war, but as a practice that can optimize
   transmedia design cycles.},

Abstract = {Public procurement is a large market affecting almost every organisation
   and individual; therefore, governments need to ensure its efficiency,
   transparency, and accountability, while creating healthy, competitive,
   and vibrant economies. In this context, open data initiatives and
   integration of data from multiple sources across national borders could
   transform the procurement market by such as lowering the barriers of
   entry for smaller suppliers and encouraging healthier competition, in
   particular by enabling cross-border bids. Increasingly more open data is
   published in the public sector; however, these are created and
   maintained in siloes and are not straightforward to reuse or maintain
   because of technical heterogeneity, lack of quality, insufficient
   metadata, or missing links to related domains. To this end, we developed
   an open linked data platform, called TheyBuyForYou, consisting of a set
   of modular APIs and ontologies to publish, curate, integrate, analyse,
   and visualise an EU-wide, cross-border, and cross-lingual procurement
   knowledge graph. We developed advanced tools and services on top of the
   knowledge graph for anomaly detection, cross-lingual document search,
   and data storytelling. This article describes the TheyBuyForYou platform
   and knowledge graph, reports their adoption by different stakeholders
   and challenges and experiences we went through while creating them, and
   demonstrates the usefulness of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies

Abstract = {This paper investigates how to make data comics interactive. Data comics
   are an effective and versatile means for visual communication,
   leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and
   visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through
   panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static
   storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding
   interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling,
   personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially
   enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations
   tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the
   traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The
   goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined
   layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to
   detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and
   interacting with data representation, to support personalization and
   reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification
   language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static
   comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited
   six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and
   asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand
   authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of
   interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding
   the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation
   tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.},

Abstract = {Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data
   insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data
   story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it
   can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's
   Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in
   film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and
   discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little
   systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's
   Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we
   examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing
   stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we
   proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual
   communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative
   intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques
   through story creation. We evaluated the proposed design space through a
   workshop with 25 participants. Results show that our design space
   provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with
   Freytag's Pyramid.},

Abstract = {Data visualization for alternative narratives is a powerful adversarial
   tool that seeks to inquire about the existing conditions of conflicts.
   Nowadays, data visualization is widely used in activist communication to
   offer data-driven counternarratives to those with dominant power.
   However, a study of 64 cases shows that most visualizations are far from
   following the open-source ethos that data activism advocates. If
   visualizations for alternative narratives do not open up their processes
   and communicate how the meaning of data is shaped and translated
   visually, they risk turning into black-box devices that crystallize
   biased representations of conflict rather than investigating them. This
   paper presents a data design framework for visualizations used in
   alternative narratives. It is presented as a methodological tool that
   encourages actionable data practices that promote a more critical and
   reflective data culture. The framework is structured in two ways of
   approaching the process of working with data: from the parts of the
   process and from the process as a whole. The first approach presents
   four lenses intended to materialize aspects of the process of working
   with and making sense of data: Open/close, Composition, Zoom, and
   Sanitization. The second approach proposes a self-hacking operation of
   disclosing the production process of the visualizations. This paper
   argues that visualizations for alternative narratives ought to be open
   artifacts that promote the democratization of re-interpretation and
   critical data by disclosing the design decisions that were made on the
   dataset, as well as its visual, and interactive representation.},

   Methods to Translate Radio Production to Interaction Design},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {6, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {We present a first-person, retrospective exploration of two radio
   sonification pieces that employ narrative scaffolding to teach audiences
   how to listen to data. To decelerate and articulate design processes
   that occurred at the rapid pace of radio production, the sound designer
   and producer wrote retrospective design accounts. We then revisited the
   radio pieces through principles drawn from guidance design, data
   storytelling, visualization literacy, and sound studies. Finally, we
   speculated how these principles might be applied through interactive,
   voice-based technologies. First-person methods enabled us to access the
   implicit knowledge embedded in radio production and translate it to
   technologies of interest to the human-computer-interaction community,
   such as voice user interfaces that rely on auditory display.
   Traditionally, sonification practitioners have focused more on
   generating sounds than on teaching people how to listen; our process,
   however, treated sound and narrative as a holistic, sonic-narrative
   experience. Our first-person retrospection illuminated the role of
   narrative in designing to support people as they learn to listen to

   results in reinforcing effects and an increase in stock market

Abstract = {With the proliferation of big data and business analytics practices,
   data storytelling has gained increasing importance as an effective means
   for communicating analytical insights to the target audience to support
   decision-making and improve business performance. However, there is a
   limited empirical understanding of the relationship between data
   storytelling competency, decision-making quality, and business
   performance. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), this study
   develops and validates the concept of data storytelling competency as a
   multidimensional construct consisting of data quality, story quality,
   storytelling tool quality, storyteller skills, and storyteller domain
   knowledge. It also develops a mediation model to examine the
   relationship between data storytelling competency and business
   performance, and whether this relationship is mediated by
   decision-making quality. Based on an empirical analysis of data
   collected from business analytics practitioners, the results of this
   study reveal that the data storytelling competency is positively linked
   to business performance, which is partially mediated by decision-making
   quality. These results provide a theoretical basis for further
   investigation of possible antecedents and consequences of data
   storytelling competency. They also offer guidance for practitioners on
   how to leverage data storytelling capabilities in business analytics

Abstract = {Innovation in journalism became an important element to determine the
   current and future direction of the profession. Through incremental and
   cumulative transformations over time, because of many obstacles faced
   inside the newsrooms, journalism has suffered from significant and
   fundamental changes, including the deployment of data journalism. In
   Latin America, the practice has seen an increasing expansion in the last
   years. Nevertheless, there are important technological gaps that limit
   its development. The present study draws upon literature on data
   journalism, media management, and sociology, aiming to contribute
   theoretically to data journalism research. Our findings show that beyond
   the technological approach, practitioners are relying on data
   evangelists, collaboration, and audience-centered innovation to produce
   data storytelling in their newsrooms. On the other hand, these alliances
   form ``homophily{''} and ``endogamy{''} features that limit the
   dissemination of the practice, which must consider the potential
   implications for the social distance of the audiences. It argues that
   Latin American professionals are distancing themselves from
   technological determinism to embrace a more audience-centric innovation
   in newsrooms. Finally, it also states that it is important to take into
   account those limitations, as they pose obstacles for data journalism
   innovation research knowledge. The article concludes with an agenda for
   future research.},

Abstract = {Tracking the sensemaking process is a well-established practice in many
   data analysis tools, and many visualization tools facilitate overview
   and recall during and after exploration. However, the resulting
   communication materials such as presentations or infographics often omit
   provenance information for the sake of simplicity. This unfortunately
   limits later viewers from engaging in further collaborative sensemaking
   or discussion about the analysis. We present a design study where we
   introduced visual provenance and analytics to urban transportation
   planning. Maintaining the provenance of all analyses was critical to
   support collaborative sensemaking among the many and diverse
   stakeholders. Our system, STORYFACETS, exposes several different views
   of the same analysis session, each view designed for a specific
   audience: (1) the trail view provides a data flow canvas that supports
   in-depth exploration + provenance (expert analysts); (2) the dashboard
   view organizes visualizations and other content into a space-filling
   layout to support high-level analysis (managers); and (3) the slideshow
   view supports linear storytelling via interactive step-by-step
   presentations (laypersons). Views are linked so that when one is
   changed, provenance is maintained. Visual provenance is available on
   demand to support iterative sensemaking for any team member.},

   currently being read by the user, as captured by eye-tracking. These
   interventions were previously evaluated in two user studies that
   involved 98 participants reading excerpts of real-world MSNVs during a
   1-hour session. Participants' outcomes included their subjective
   feedback about the guidance, and well as their reading time and score on
   a set of comprehension questions. Results showed that the interventions
   can increase comprehension of the MSNV excerpts for users with lower
   levels of a cognitive skill known as visualization literacy. In this
   article, we aim to further investigate this result by leveraging
   eye-tracking to analyze in depth how the participants processed the
   interventions depending on their levels of visualization literacy. We
   first analyzed summative gaze metrics that capture how users process and
   integrate the key components of the narrative visualizations. Second, we
   mined the salient patterns in the users' scanpaths to contextualize how
   users sequentially process these components. Results indicate that the
   interventions succeed in guiding attention to salient components of the
   narrative visualizations, especially by generating more transitions
   between key components of the visualization (i.e., datapoints, labels,
   and legend), as well as between the two modalities (text and
   visualization). We also show that the interventions help users with
   lower levels of visualization literacy to better map datapoints to the
   legend, which likely contributed to their improved comprehension of the
   documents. These findings shed light on how adaptive interventions help
   users with different levels of visualization literacy, informing the
   design of personalized narrative visualizations.},

Abstract = {This study introduces a synthesised framework for the analysis of data
   visualisations in the news. Through a close examination of seminal
   content analyses, their methodologies and findings, this article
   proposes a framework that consolidates dimensional components of data
   visualisations previously scattered across this body of research. To
   transition from incidental and essentialist examinations of visual data
   artefacts towards a systematic and theory-informed exploration, we
   consider the diagrammatic dimensions of data visualisations. The offered
   synthesized framework can serve as a starting point for both
   theory-infused descriptive purposes as well as more theory-guided
   explorations. The framework is put to the test by analysing 185
   visualisations drawn from award-winning data stories. Findings generated
   through the application of the framework highlight the varied
   composition of components of data visualisations, though certain
   combinations of components are prevalent, leading to static categorical
   comparisons or interactive spatial localization. After all, data
   artefacts can be understood as problem-posing elements that are the
   outcome of diagrammatic thinking that journalists employ to communicate
   claims.},

Abstract = {Academic journal articles often do not embody the rich accounts of
   long-term qualitative field work, while creative storytelling offers
   researchers an alternative way to reflect upon and communicate their
   findings. Digital storytelling is an emerging research methodology
   increasingly used to gather qualitative data but not so often to
   communicate results. As part of the ICT4COP research project, which
   investigates community policing and police-reform in post-conflict
   settings, we decided to try out digital storytelling to communicate some
   of the findings from the research. During the process, we observed that
   the digital storytelling methodology led researchers to approach their
   data differently. This article explores our adapted digital storytelling
   methodology. We draw similarities with ethnographic storytelling and
   highlight the digital storytelling methodology both as a means of
   dissemination, as well as an alternative approach to data interpretation

Abstract = {There are many multiple-stage racing competitions in various sports such
   as swimming, running, or cycling. The wide availability of affordable
   tracking devices facilitates monitoring the position along with the race
   of all participants, even for non-professional contests. Getting
   real-time information of contenders is useful but also unleashes the
   possibility of creating more complex visualization systems that ease the
   understanding of the behavior of all participants during a simple stage
   or throughout the whole competition. In this paper we focus on bicycle
   races, which are highly popular, especially in Europe, being the Tour de
   France its greatest exponent. Current visualizations from TV
   broadcasting or real-time tracking websites are useful to understand the
   current stage status, up to a certain extent. Unfortunately, still no
   current system exists that visualizes a whole multi-stage contest in
   such a way that users can interactively explore the relevant events of a
   single stage (e.g. breakaways, groups, virtual leadership horizontal
   ellipsis ), as well as the full competition. In this paper, we present
   an interactive system that is useful both for aficionados and
   professionals to visually analyze the development of multi-stage cycling

Abstract = {Data-driven stories comprise of visualizations and a textual narrative.
   The two representations coexist and complement each other. Although
   existing research has explored the design strategies and structure of

   linked with each other. In this paper, we aim at understanding the
   fine-grained interplay of text and visualizations in geographic
   data-driven stories. We focus on geographic content as it often includes
   complex spatiotemporal data presented as versatile visualizations and
   rich textual descriptions. We conduct a qualitative empirical study on
   22 stories collected from a variety of news media outlets; 10 of the
   stories report the COVID-19 pandemic, the others cover diverse topics.
   We investigate the role of every sentence and visualization within the
   narrative to reveal how they reference each other and interact.
   Moreover, we explore the positioning and sequence of various parts of
   the narrative to find patterns that further consolidate the stories.
   Drawing from the findings, we discuss study implications with respect to
   best practices and possibilities to automate the report generation.},

Abstract = {Emerging narratives call for recognising and engaging constructively
   with small-scale farmers who have a leading role in shaping the current
   irrigation dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper explores whether
   new irrigation data can usefully inform these narratives. It argues
   that, for a variety of reasons, official irrigation data in sub-Saharan
   Africa fail to capture the full extent and diverse nature of irrigation
   and its rapid distributed growth over the last two decades. The paper
   investigates recent trends in the use of remote sensing methods to
   generate irrigation data; it examines the associated expectation that
   these techniques enable a better understanding of current irrigation
   developments and small-scale farmers' roles. It reports on a pilot study
   that uses radar-based imagery and analysis to provide new insights into
   the extent of rice irrigated agriculture in three regions of Tanzania.
   We further stress that such mapping exercises remain grounded in a
   binary logic that separates `irrigation' from other `non-irrigated'
   landscape features. They can stem from, and reinforce, a conventional
   understanding of irrigation that is still influenced by colonial
   legacies of engineering design and agricultural modernisation. As
   farmers' initiatives question this dominant view of irrigation, and in a
   policy context that is dominated by narratives of water scarcity, this
   means that new data may improve the visibility of water use by
   small-scale irrigators but may also leave them more exposed to
   restrictions favouring more powerful water users. The paper thus calls
   for moving away from a narrow debate on irrigation data and monitoring,
   and towards a holistic discussion of the nature of irrigation
   development in sub-Saharan Africa. This discussion is necessary to
   support a constructive engagement with farmer-led irrigation
   development; it is also challenging in that it involves facing
   entrenched vested interests and requires changes in development
   practices.},

   Constructing Data-Driven Policy Narratives},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of data-driven narratives to examine how
   the use of information, communications, and media technologies (ICMTs)
   impacts the sustainable growth of economies. While ICMTs have regularly
   been advocated as a policy tool for growth and development, there is a
   research gap in empirical studies validating how such policies may be
   effective. This analysis is based on historical panel data from 39
   economies across the developed North (19) and developing South (20). The
   industry-standard Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining
   (CRISP-DM) methodology was applied to construct narratives that weave
   extant theories with empirical data. The art of developing data-driven
   narratives is rarely addressed in previous research articles. In the
   narrative approach, prior research on how ICMTs and sustainable growth
   are quantitatively scored and measured is reviewed. Panel data from
   authoritative sources such as the United Nations, World Economic Forum,
   and Sustainable Society Index were collected, cleansed, and
   conglomerated for data analytics. This was followed by evidence-based
   reasoning to examine any possible relationships between ICMT development
   and the sustainable growth of economies across the ``North{''} and
   ``South{''}. The findings reveal that there are differentiated outcomes
   in sustainable growth in high- and low-income economies. This poses
   legitimate questions as to whether low-income economies will be able to
   meet the UN's Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 through the
   intermediation of ICMTs. It is the intended contribution of this paper
   to exemplify how data-driven narratives using CRISP may construct rich
   stories about ICMT for sustainability for the purposes of sharing good
   practice as well as lessons learned.},

   Data-Driven Storytelling},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The current paper focuses on the development of an enhanced Mobile
   Journalism (MoJo) model for soundscape heritage crowdsourcing,
   data-driven storytelling, and management in the era of big data and the
   semantic web. Soundscapes and environmental sound semantics have a great
   impact on cultural heritage, also affecting the quality of human life,
   from multiple perspectives. In this view, context- and location-aware
   mobile services can be combined with state-of-the-art machine and deep
   learning approaches to offer multilevel semantic analysis monitoring of
   sound-related heritage. The targeted utilities can offer new insights
   toward sustainable growth of both urban and rural areas. Much emphasis
   is also put on the multimodal preservation and auralization of special
   soundscape areas and open ancient theaters with remarkable acoustic
   behavior, representing important cultural artifacts. For this purpose, a
   pervasive computing architecture is deployed and investigated, utilizing
   both client- and cloud-wise semantic analysis services, to implement and
   evaluate the envisioned MoJo methodology. Elaborating on

Abstract = {Motivation: Narrative visualization for scientific data explorations can
   help users better understands the domain knowledge, because narrative
   visualizations often present a sequence of facts and observations linked
   together by a unifying theme or argument. Narrative visualization in
   immersive environments can provide users with an intuitive experience to
   interactively explore the scientific data, because immersive
   environments provide a brand new strategy for interactive scientific
   data visualization and exploration. However, it is challenging to
   develop narrative scientific visualization in immersive environments. In
   this article, we propose an immersive narrative visualization tool to
   create and customize scientific data explorations for ordinary users
   with little knowledge about programming on scientific visualization.
   They are allowed to define point of interests (POIs) conveniently by the
   handler of an immersive device.
   Results: Automatic exploration animations with narrative annotations can
   be generated by the gradual transitions between consecutive POI pairs.
   Besides, interactive slicing can be also controlled by device handler.
   Evaluations including user study and case study are designed and
   conducted to show the usability and effectiveness of the proposed tool.},

Abstract = {Causality visualization can help people understand temporal chains of
   events, such as messages sent in a distributed system, cause and effect
   in a historical conflict, or the interplay between political actors over
   time. However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences
   grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this
   paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven
   storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose
   a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal
   data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where
   participants were asked to recover causality information from two
   causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and
   without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe
   CAUSEWORKS, a causality visualization system for understanding how
   specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates
   an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We
   validate CAUSEWORKS through interviews with experts who used the system
   for understanding complex events.},

Abstract = {We examine the process of designing an exhibit to communicate scientific
   findings from a complex dataset and unfamiliar domain to the public in a
   science museum. Our exhibit sought to communicate new lessons based on
   scientific findings from the domain of metagenomics. This multi-user
   exhibit had three goals: (1) to inform the public about microbial
   communities and their daily cycles; (2) to link microbes' activity to
   the concept of gene expression; (3) and to highlight scientists' use of
   gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. To address
   these three goals, we derived visualization designs with three
   corresponding stories, each corresponding to a goal. We present three
   successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to convey
   these goals. We could successfully present one story but had limited
   success with our second and third goals. This work presents a detailed
   account of an attempt to explain tightly coupled relationships through
   storytelling and animation in a multi-user, informal learning
   environment to a public with varying prior knowledge on the domain and
   identify lessons for future design.},

Abstract = {Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such
   as a poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented
   storytelling to facilitate the understanding and memorization of the
   story content. Although useful, technique barriers, such as data
   analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual
   data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and
   experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system,
   Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet
   through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the
   generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope
   incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that
   explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively
   generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical
   order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information
   theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an
   automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique
   through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series
   of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope
   is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.},

Abstract = {GIFs are enjoying increasing popularity on social media as a format for
   data-driven storytelling with visualization; simple visual messages are
   embedded in short animations that usually last less than 15 seconds and
   are played in automatic repetition. In this paper, we ask the question,
   ``What makes a data-GIF understandable?{''} While other storytelling
   formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively
   well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and
   principles for ``data-GIFs{''}. To close this gap, we provide results
   from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118
   participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the
   understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis
   are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108
   data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design
   dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context
   preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core
   message. The paper concludes with a list of suggestions for creating
   more effective Data-GIFs.},

Abstract = {A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet
   psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that
   these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to
   communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around
   half a million Reddit posts in the sub -communities specialised in 14
   medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep -learning framework.
   In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions
   with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work
   designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from
   the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug
   prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To
   finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological,
   psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a
   narrative -style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study
   involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a
   considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held
   opinions: 10\% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of
   medical conditions, and 27\% were more favourable to the use of social
   media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive
   elements in interactive visualizations.},

Title = {Towards Hermeneutic Visualization in Digital Literary Studies},
Journal = {DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {15},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data
   visualizations for digital literary studies. Hermeneutic approaches in
   the digital humanities have been rather agnostic about the
   epistemological premises of hermeneutic theory. These can be summarized
   as (1) differentiation author/text, (2) hermeneutic circle and (3)
   dependency text/recipient. In this article, we present the concept of
   hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap between
   ``classic{''} literary hermeneutics and the emerging practice of digital
   literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on
   epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences,
   it is not well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we
   argue that the digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a
   critical interface and visualization concept. We discuss four postulates
   that can be used as guidelines and help transform ``more traditional{''}
   data visualization into hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the
   epistemological foundations of hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the
   usefulness of the postulates with an interactive prototype Stereoscope
   designed to support them.((1))},

Abstract = {Data-driven storytelling helps to communicate facts, easing
   comprehension and decision making, particularly in crisis settings such
   as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Several studies have reported on
   general practices and guidelines to follow in order to create effective
   narrative visualizations. However, research regarding the benefits of
   implementing those practices and guidelines in software development is
   limited. In this article, we present a case study that explores the
   benefits of including data visualization best practices in the
   development of a software system for the current health crisis. We
   performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis of sixteen graphs
   required by the system to monitor patients' isolation and circulation

Abstract = {We analyze the relations between ethnographic data and theory through an
   examination of materiality in research practices, arguing that data
   production is a form of material theorizing. This entails reviewing and
   (re-)applying practice-theoretical discussions on materiality to
   questions of ethnography, and moving from understanding theory primarily
   as ideas to observing theorizing in all steps of research practice. We
   introduce ``pocketing{''} as a heuristic concept to analyze how and when
   ethnographic data materializes: the concept defines data's materiality
   relationally, through the affective and temporal dimensions of practice.
   It is discussed using two examples: in a study on everyday architectural
   experience where ethnographic data materialized as bodies affected by
   architecture; and in a study on digital cooperation where research
   data's materialization was distributed over time according to the use of
   a company database. By conceptualizing data's materiality as
   practice-bound, ``pocketing{''} facilitates understanding the links
   between data and theory in ethnographic data production.},

Pages = {549-568},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to examine participants' perspectives in
   organization-sponsored training and provides support for further
   research positioning the trainer as an organizational leader.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The interactions described in the trainees' experiences were examined
   through a social constructivist lens. Interviews were conducted to
   collect data. Narratives were analyzed to reach interpretation.
   Findings
   Interview results identified four themes, namely, relevance and
   applicability of training received, the formation of attitudes and
   preferences among the trainee participants, immediacy in the use of the
   training received and relational and organizational influence that
   furthers leader-member exchange in the workplace.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study examined participants' perspectives in workplace training and
   provides support for further research: examining communication's role in
   workplace learning; exploring the training process; and positioning the
   trainer as an organizational leader.
   Practical implications
   This study provides empirical data to support changes in instructional
   communication models and exploring the process of training. Trainers'
   relational building with trainees could impact many outcomes in their
   training efforts that are detailed in this study.
   Originality/value
   This study uses a collection of methods to address the trainees'
   experience in formal workplace learning. It demonstrates the power of
   trainers to influence what the trainees think of training content,
   format and relational learning.},

Abstract = {This article explores the intersections between interactive documentary
   and digital rights, across notions of surveillance, privacy and data.
   The collection of personal and sensitive data online increases
   exponentially, and individuals become a series of data points, only of
   relevance insofar as we are part of a larger group marked by similar
   characteristics. Yet somewhat contradictorily, we are also scrutinized
   completely. How might creative media production bridge this gap -
   recognizing our individual complexity while respecting rights to
   privacy? Documentary media offers one response - individual stories and
   voices can serve to flesh out a complex story while retaining links to a
   broader narrative. Interactive documentary, furthermore, can offer a
   reflexive form of storytelling that uses the very forms of technology in
   question to highlight the potential problems. This article presents case
   studies of interactive documentaries, exploring how the strategies of
   reflexivity and responsiveness can engender an understanding of issues
   of digital rights.},

Abstract = {Studies abound on international migration and remittances across the
   world and studies are particularly not lacking on the subject in Africa.
   There are however few studies on the moderating roles of information
   communication technology (ICT) and social media in the relationships
   among international migration, remittances and relationships in
   Sub-Saharan Africa. This article examines the dimension of ICT and
   social media in migration studies. This is an aspect that has often been
   ignored and overlooked even though ICT and social media have great
   contributions in the international migration process particularly as
   migrants and relatives in sending and receiving countries both have the
   primary experience. Research objectives include: reasons for emigration;
   information technology/social media used by migrants and their kin as
   they relate across spaces; and how ICT affects relationships of kin and
   international migrants. Secondary data were gathered through journals,
   books, documents and reliable Internet sources. Primary data were
   gathered in Ibadan, Nigeria in 2018 through 30 in-depth interviews
   analysed through content analysis. Findings reveal the nature of ICT
   used by international migrants and their kin and purpose of utilization
   and the effects of ICT on international migration, remittances and
   kinship networks. The article presents detailed data, narratives,
   interpretations and implications of relationships among international
   migration, ICT/social media and kinship networks. This article argues
   that ICT/social media is central to international migration
   decision-making, access of migrants and kin to social forces and factors
   motivating international migration, and it is very important to how
   migrants and kin maintain and/or weaken relationships and access to
   remittances and utilization.},

Abstract = {We conduct an eye tracking study to investigate perception
   text-embellished narrative visualizations under different task
   conditions. Study stimuli are data visualizations embellished with
   text-based elements: annotations, captions, labels, and descriptive
   text. We consider three common viewing tasks that occur when these types
   of graphics are viewed: (1) simple observation, (2) active search to
   answer a query, and (3) information memorization for later recall. The
   overarching goal is to understand, at a perceptual level, if and how
   task affects how these visualizations are interacted with. By analyzing
   collected gaze data and conducting advanced semantic scanpath analysis,
   we find, at a high level, diverse patterns of gaze behavior: simple
   observation and information memorization lead to similar optical viewing
   strategies, while active search significantly diverges, both in regards
   to which areas of the visualization are focused upon and how often
   embellishments are interacted with. We discuss study outcomes in the
   context of embellishing visualizations with text for various usage
   scenarios. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf

Abstract = {This article argues that selfieing and data visualization, in mutually

   the digital epoch: knowledge generation not as truth claims, but as
   effects of visibility. Drawing on Foucault's proposition of visibility
   in his archaeological approaches to human sciences, this study aims to
   show that the governing mode of knowledge formation today consists of
   layers of visibility. I propose to use the concept metavisibility to
   make sense of the nexus of visibilities instantiated by selfieing and
   data visualization. This study is intended as a theoretical inquiry
   rather than an empirical study. The methodological intervention is
   manifold: first, to respond to contentions that pronounce the diminished
   relevance of the visual in a world of vibrant multisensory media;
   second, to dialogue with studies of the problematic of visibility in the
   digital context; and, third, to critique discursive formulations of
   digital media that appear complacent about the power of digitized

   constructing narrative visualization with video. We review the
   structural aspects of documentary film with examples relevant for
   narrative visualization. Using six of the highest quality video-based

   three pairs of videos. The video pairs were specifically matched to
   highlight unique features available in documentary film. Using the
   preferences expressed by our participants, we performed an empirical
   study to examine the documentary features most valued by our

Journal = {COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {In the visualization community, it is often assumed that visual data
   storytelling increases memorability and engagement, making it more
   effective at communicating information. However, many assumptions about
   the efficacy of storytelling in visualization lack empirical evaluation.
   Contributing to an emerging body of work, we study whether selected
   techniques commonly used in visual data storytelling influence people's
   attitudes towards immigration. We compare (a) personal visual narratives
   designed to generate empathy; (b) structured visual narratives of
   aggregates of people; and (c) an exploratory visualization without
   narrative acting as a control condition. We conducted two crowdsourced
   between-subject studies comparing the three conditions, each with 300
   participants. To assess the differences in attitudes between conditions,
   we adopted established scales from the social sciences used in the
   European Social Survey (ESS). Although we found some differences between
   conditions, the effects on people's attitudes are smaller than we
   expected. Our findings suggest that we need to be more careful when it
   comes to our expectations about the effects visual data storytelling can
   have on attitudes. Additional material:

Title = {Authoring logically sequenced visual data stories with Gravity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {58},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Visual data stories have been shown to significantly aid the
   comprehension and short-term memorability of statistical facts and value
   messages. Hence, they are a promising medium for communicating complex
   information to a target audience, fulfilling the communicative goal of
   information visualisation. However, creating visual data stories often
   requires a plethora of tools to execute the visual data story creation
   process - creating visualisations, developing a logical connection
   between visualisations, and presenting the story based on the
   meaningfully sequenced visualisations. Current information visualisation
   tools either focus primarily on exploration or lack sequencing models
   for visualisation presentation, even though transitioning and sequencing
   have been shown to affect user understanding and interpretation of
   visualisations. We present Gravity, a system that consolidates the
   different phases of the visual data story creation process, and
   recommends and visualises logically sequenced sets of interactive
   visualisations to support the presentation of coherent narratives and
   visual data stories. We also report on an evaluation study with
   representative participants. Our results show that participants learned
   to use the system within a short time and successfully created visual
   data stories with minimal guidance.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {24},
Number = {2},
Pages = {149-162},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {In this paper I draw on my experiences of listening to migrant and
   refugee women's stories of displacement and explore questions around
   discourses and practices of listening across borders and languages. In
   doing so, I particularly focus on the materiality of listening, the
   force of corporeal voices, the rhythms of oral narratives and their
   effects on understanding and making connections within the web of human
   relations. Following tracks and traces of a rich body of literature
   around sounds, voices and texts in narrative analytics and feminist
   theory, I have turned my attention to aurality and I have suggested
   narrative rhythmanalysis as a mode of understanding and as a method.
   What I argue is that turning our attention to listening practices as a
   neglected process in theoretical analysis illuminates the perspective of
   the storyteller, mobilizes affective forces in the milieu of relational
   narratives and enacts the materiality of knowledge through the intensity
   and uniqueness of the corporeal voice. What I finally suggest is that
   perhaps we should move beyond the imperatives of clarity and
   transparency in an attempt to be in the world with others. Here the
   sound of narratives could become a trope that can take us down the path
   of decolonizing our ways of knowing and understanding.},

Abstract = {This article explores datawalking as a novel method in media and

   the deep mediatized city faces challenges that pertain to the

Abstract = {Short-form videos are an increasingly prevalent medium for storytelling

   design workshop with experienced video, animation designers and
   visualization experts to discuss principles and practices for augmenting
   short-form videos with data visualizations. After the workshop, we
   summarized the participants' design considerations and proposed 20
   design guidelines. We further collected design purposes of the
   participants and associated these purposes with the guidelines. Finally,
   we conducted a crowd-sourcing study and a task-based evaluation to
   validate the effectiveness and usability of the guidelines. Results
   indicate that our guidelines can significantly improve the videos
   accompanied with data visualizations and help novices easily obtain
   desired knowledge when augmenting videos.},

Abstract = {A growing number of scientific publications is available to promote
   sustainable river management. However, these publications target
   researchers rather than water management professionals who are
   responsible for the implementation of management practices. To bridge
   this science-to-practice gap, we conceptualize and propose a series of
   steps to prepare effective storylines targeted at a practitioner
   audience. We developed this approach within a research program that
   supports integrated and collaborative river management. We prepared
   three storylines, each based on one scientific publication. The
   storylines combined text and interactive visuals using the ESRI
   StoryMaps tool to make them available online. Via focus groups with 44
   participants from research and practice, we evaluated the perceived
   usefulness of and engagement with the content and design. We collected
   feedback from participants using a survey as well as via audio and
   screen recordings. Our findings show that we should narrow down the
   audience of the storylines by tailoring them to the needs of project
   managers rather than specialized advisors. Therefore, the content should
   offer more than a visual summary of the research by showing examples of
   the management application. A more engaging sequence with a clear
   protagonist is further required to better relate to the problem and the
   potential application. Although visuals and interactive elements were
   considered attractive, a multi-disciplinary editorial team is necessary
   to better complement the visuals' design to the text. The level of
   detail of participants' feedback shows that involving project managers
   to co-create storylines can be an important step for improvement.},

   data videos examining their narrative and visual approaches. We propose
   that our taxonomy can be used to explain the characteristics or design

Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 31},
Abstract = {Transmedia storytelling involves telling a story using multiple distinct
   media. The remit of stories that fall under this broad definition is
   vast, consequently causing theorists to examine different phenomena
   using tools that are not suitable for all forms of transmedia
   storytelling. The lack of critical tools means we are unable to
   describe, compare and analyse different experiences using common
   language. In this paper, we present our model that can be used to
   identify the fundamental structural features of a variety of transmedia
   storytelling forms. We illustrate its usage with twenty case studies and
   discuss how three groups of patterns emerge which can be identifiable in
   all transmedia stories. These patterns can be used to extend transmedia
   language and help form taxonomies, by identifying common patterns and
   their usages amongst various forms of transmedia stories.},

Abstract = {Learning in data-rich environments has been a focus of learning sciences
   research since the inception of the field, with increasing interest in
   the ways learners narrate data. This article examines the narration of

   mobilities of data, and of the narratives in which they are mobilized.
   Two case studies of data narration are presented: seventh graders in a
   social studies classroom, describing African-American migrations to and
   from a familiar neighborhood, using a census data visualization tool;
   and a presentation by the director of special education for a school
   district to the Board of Education, using data to describe trends in the
   district. Four modes of data narration are examined across cases: (1)
   telling a story about oneself working with data; (2) animating a data
   representation; (3) incorporating data into extant narratives; and (4)
   narrating oneself into a data-represented world. The analysis examines
   the ways data, narratives, and people are set in motion in each of these
   modes, and the ways the resulting mobilities mediate learning with data.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes the method of `narrative portraiture', which,
   located within the wider field of narrative studies, offers an
   analytical tool to narrative data. Two research projects, one on
   disability and one on identity, are used to illustrate how the method
   can be applied. While the paper will focus on the methodological
   benefits and limitations of the approach, throughout the article we also
   highlight the ethical concern of representation. We suggest that through
   `narrative portraiture' research findings can be contextualised in
   broader social narratives without losing sight of the unique personal
   qualities of the research encounter. Thus, we argue for the importance
   of bringing the participant and their everyday life experience into
   focus, highlighting that a portrayal of a sole story can be, not only a
   medium to understand a research phenomenon, but also a valuable research
   output in itself.},

Abstract = {Combining data content with visual embellishments, infographics can
   effectively deliver messages in an engaging and memorable manner.
   Various authoring tools have been proposed to facilitate the creation of
   infographics. However, creating a professional infographic with these
   authoring tools is still not an easy task, requiring much time and
   design expertise. Therefore, these tools are generally not attractive to
   casual users, who are either unwilling to take time to learn the tools
   or lacking in proper design expertise to create a professional
   infographic. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach: to
   automatically generate infographics from natural language statements. We
   first conducted a preliminary study to explore the design space of
   infographics. Based on the preliminary study, we built a
   proof-of-concept system that automatically converts statements about
   simple proportion-related statistics to a set of infographics with
   pre-designed styles. Finally, we demonstrated the usability and
   usefulness of the system through sample results, exhibits, and expert
   reviews.},

Abstract = {There has been a shift in gender for the veterinary medical profession,
   with little attention paid to the affects of women becoming veterinary
   students. To interrogate women becoming-veterinarians, I tell stories of
   becoming-veterinarian with a story of becoming-scholar, using narrative
   inquiry. I used data produced with current veterinary students in
   conversation with a photograph of a whiteboard and me. I embarked on an
   inventive analysis of sorting data excerpts and producing a new ``white
   coat{''} with them-embroidering participant quotes onto the white coat I
   received when I entered veterinary school. This intra-action produced
   insights about becoming and I (re)present the crystallisation of these
   analyses into narratives of becoming stitched together. In this story, I
   interrogate my role and pose questions about learning and becoming.},

Title = {Transforming Data into Poems: Poetic Inquiry Practices for Social and
   Human Sciences},
Journal = {EDUCATION AS CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Abstract = {This article argues that poetry is an act of meditation, improvisation
   and exploration, and urgency is what guides the writer into (and
   through) the poetic journey. In the light of this, this article
   illustrates the features of a workshop that was designed to guide social
   and human scientists in the delicate process of turning raw data into
   poems. One of the chief objectives of the decolonial project is to
   bridge the gap between Westernised academia ({''}The Ivory Tower{''})
   and communities where research is conducted, and this article aims to
   show how poetic inquiry is a fitting research methodology that can serve
   this purpose. Through a description of the workshop process and specific
   poems that emerged from it, it suggests that poetic inquiry is an
   innovative and effective research methodology for social and human
   scientists engaged in the transformation of conventional knowledge
   production.},

Abstract = {Fact sheets with vivid graphical design and intriguing statistical
   insights are prevalent for presenting raw data. They help audiences
   understand data-related facts effectively and make a deep impression.
   However, designing a fact sheet requires both data and design expertise
   and is a laborious and time-consuming process. One needs to not only
   understand the data in depth but also produce intricate graphical
   representations. To assist in the design process, we present DataShot
   which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated system that
   creates fact sheets automatically from tabular data. First, we conduct a
   qualitative analysis of 245 infographic examples to explore general
   infographic design space at both the sheet and element levels. We
   identify common infographic structures, sheet layouts, fact types, and
   visualization styles during the study. Based on these findings, we
   propose a fact sheet generation pipeline, consisting of fact extraction,
   fact composition, and presentation synthesis, for the auto-generation
   workflow. To validate our system, we present use cases with three
   real-world datasets. We conduct an in-lab user study to understand the
   usage of our system. Our evaluation results show that DataShot can
   efficiently generate satisfactory fact sheets to support further
   customization and data presentation.},
